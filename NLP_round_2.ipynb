gracechurch, lockport_, which appeared in january, , is now exhausted;as there is a constant demand for it, a second is deemed necessary; andthe occasion seemed favorable for a little further talk about windowsand glass. hence this pamphlet.the project of four years ago is no longer an insubstantial dream.since that time eleven windows and three mosaics have been placed ingrace church; in them all the adopted scheme has been followed, withresults more and more obviously satisfactory.although intending this pamphlet, in the first instance, simply fora guide to his own people, to lead them to a more discriminatingappreciation: the author is encouraged to hope, by many expressionsfrom the outside, that it will, even more than the earlier _report_, beof service beyond his parish; that it may perhaps stimulate elsewherealso a study of church glass, and the erection of true church windows.                                                             w. f. f.grace church rectory, lockport, all saints’, .                        stained glass windows.the subject is certainly one of present interest. the advertisements offirms who produce stained glass windows are numerous and conspicuousin our church weeklies; glowing accounts of memorials just erected inthis place and that make up a large part of our “diocesan news.” tosay nothing of the fact that we are in danger of forgetting what thereal business of the church is,――that it is not primarily to build andbeautify edifices, but to save men and to establish righteousness inthe earth; the uncomfortable question is forced upon us: for how muchof this “embellishment” of our churches will posterity thank us?a revival of religious art we welcome with profound gratitude. but whenfor the moment it threatens to take the form of an epidemic of stainedglass, our joy may be turned to apprehension. stained glass is simplybecoming fashionable; everybody is beginning to want some of it because‘all the other churches are getting some;’ commercial enterprisestimulates a well-meaning zeal, taking advantage, too, of a vulgarspirit of rivalry; and the end thereof must be painful to contemplate.individuals are often given a free hand in god’s house on the groundthat thus several hundred or several thousand dollars will be securedfor “enrichment;” and so the work goes merrily on.and such things can be because there is a lack of knowledge. personsmay have the best intention in the world; their experience in other,different fields may have been very wide; in a general way they mayhave good taste; moreover, they may possess a long purse and a liberaldisposition; perhaps they may think to save themselves from going wrongby putting the whole matter into the hands of strongly advertisedwindow-makers. but none of these things will supply the lack of aknowledge of stained glass. there is nothing for it but study andeducation. the clergy first of all, and after them the vestries, mustinform themselves on the subject as thoroughly as possible. in themeantime, let them be slow to lend themselves to anything which theylater, or those who come after them, might bitterly deplore and behelpless to remedy.nor is it to-day so forbidding a task to get this knowledge as itwas but a few years ago. then one had to go to the libraries in ourlargest cities, and laboriously gather from rare works the historyand principles of this art. now there is fortunately at least onesingle volume, easily obtainable, which may serve as a text-book toall who desire to study the subject. mr. lewis f. day has given us inhis _windows: a book about stained and painted glass_, published inlondon, , by b. t. batsford, imported by the scribners, just thatinformation which is needed. no vestry that has the matter of stainedglass memorials before it should permit its rector to be without thisbook; he should read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest it; but not heonly; they also, at least the members of any committee responsiblefor such work; and intending donors likewise, who desire to have acontrolling voice in regard to memorials to be erected. this is tooimportant a thing to enter upon recklessly or at the dictation of merefancy.                   *       *       *       *       *meanwhile it may not be out of place to tell briefly and simply whatstained glass windows in a church ought to be; and what stained glassitself is.stained glass windows are still, after all, windows: and windows areessential component parts of a building. if in a church, the axiomapplies the more inevitably: a church is a building presumed to conformrigidly to a certain type; and therefore, the idea which the whole isto exhibit and impress must not for a moment be hidden or dissipated byany component part.our dwelling houses may be often built in a haphazard way, with aview simply to utility, regardless of style, laying no claim toarchitectural art. but to build a church so is an offense, an offenseto art, and, we believe, an offense to religion also. a church buildingis presumed and expected to have a certain character, technicallycalled “style,” dignifying and elevating god’s house above our commonhouses, even though it be small and plain and not costly; smalland plain it may be, and not costly, but it must not be tawdry orincongruous or mean.now a window is, as we have said, a component part of the building.in a church well conceived, the window is inevitable just as it is:to make it larger or smaller, to close one up where now there is oneor to make one where there is none, is just so far to do violence tothe building. if such a change does not violate the integrity of thebuilding as a whole, the fact simply goes to show that the building hadno plan worthy of honor.the window-space is therefore always to be preserved for windowuse――just such and just so much as the architect gave us. the use of awindow (barring for the moment the unscientific one of ventilation) isto give light while still affording shelter. and this light-space isalso to serve artistically as a kind of balance to the dark space ofthe solid wall; hence this light-space is to art sacred, and must bepermitted to the end to assert itself as just what it is and such as itis, so much rightly apportioned and correctly proportioned translucentwall-space.when this window-space has been first filled with a plain glass, whichis then to give way to stained glass, the new treatment must say, justas obviously, only more beautifully, what the old said: it must stillbe a window――letting in light, though now the light is colored――and inits architectural value it must be just what it was before, assertingthe shape and the design of the structural window, plainly andfaithfully.in other words, the true stained glass window――in a church buildingworthy of that name――is not now to give the beholder the impressionthat he is looking out through an opening and seeing, of somethingbeyond, so much as the size of the opening will permit: in a word, thespectacular impression of looking into some beautiful out-door worldthrough a hole in the wall. the beholder must be conscious still oflooking at the wall itself, the translucent part of it, which confineshim within the edifice as much as the stone or the brick. nor yet isthe true stained glass window merely a colored glass picture coveringso much wall area: the outline form is to be so obvious, and thetreatment so non-realistic, that the architectural idea may never for amoment be in danger of submersion under some other idea.for, as is true in general of decorative art as contrasted withpictorial art, the true church window is to be designed withoutperspective, without shadow, without attempt at realistic effect. it isto be conventional, symbolical; with that intent it may utilize as itwill forms, colors, attitudes, postures, accessories, fearless of thecriticism that ‘this saint or that scene never in the world looked likethat.’ no intelligent person standing before decorative painting wouldfor a moment think of demanding a representation of the actual. that,frankly, was not its object.and the stained glass church window will further fulfill its particularend if all round the figure or group, or whatever be the subject matterof the composition, there runs a clear line or border of differentlycolored glass, making a clear demarcation from the stone wall; drawingagain, as it were, the architect’s line of his window construction.all of which is but to say that windows were made for the sake of thebuilding, and so must remain; not that a building was made for thesake of windows,――for the sake of furnishing so much space for somany square yards of somebody’s beautiful glass. which ought to beself-evident, though to many persons it is not.                   *       *       *       *       *so regarding it now, the further question naturally occurs as to thetreatment of the several windows of one particular church. for, eachindividual window might be in itself correct according to the aboveprinciples, and yet the total effect sadly lacking in unity and harmony.there is first of all the consideration of style: a difficult matterto define, yet not, after all, so difficult to determine. what oughtcertainly not to determine it is the chance ability of some wealthydonor or donors to pay for the costliest work that could be produced;nor, on the other hand, the limited ability of others who could giveonly something inexpensive. the style of the building and its generalcharacter must determine the degree of splendor and ornateness whichwill be right for each and all the windows. if there be wealth to dostill more, then exercise sober self-restraint. if there be availablemeans only to do part of what the building demands, better do just somuch as can be rightly and adequately done, though the scheme shouldwait many years for its entire completion. in building a new church,let this also be thought of in advance.then there is the question of a single scheme of subjects for all thewindows, so that all when completed shall tell, chapter by chapter,one great story, or part by part, one great truth: say, the christianfaith, or the redemption of man, or the sacramental economy of grace,or the history of religion, or the mission of the church in theworld. thus again, as in old time, will the church windows instructthe people, and the sum total of that instruction will be a unity,with harmony and interrelation of parts, of the utmost value to soundchristian thinking and feeling, and to symmetry of christian character.for it is just this which our modern religion so much lacks: the sadresult of sectarian thinking and teaching, where each hath a doctrine,a truth, and few the whole doctrine and the wholeness of truth.individualism, let us realize, is not what the church should foster:though individuality, in its rightful place, be precious and sacred.the application here is not fanciful. sadly absurd examples there are,where ecclesiastical art has been pressed into service by sectarianminds (not among the sects alone) to teach some one portion or fragmentof truth through the eye every time the eye gazed upon the interior ofthe house of worship and fell upon the favorite symbol or picture.but not this alone. individualism is rampant in our day in theform of utterly arbitrary choice of subjects, as well as of theirmode of treatment in point of material, color, scale of drawing,and――expensiveness. a babel of confusion is the result, and that insome of our foremost churches, which have become thereby rather picturegalleries or museums adapted to the study of all schools and alltastes, than restful, devotional, solemnizing and uplifting temples forthe worship of almighty god. a low motive ruled, and how can one helpfeeling it as one looks upon the performance?――here the wealthy donor,or the ambitious so-called artist, forgetting whose this house was,demanded worship for himself. “verily, they have their reward.”therefore let those who have such things in charge study first of allwhat a church should be, and then what their particular church, suchas they have received it in trust, is. it will often be found that abuilding very little esteemed has something to say for itself, andis worthy of respect as originally conceived, in its own structuralcharacter as designed by its architect. and if not, and if it mustbe borne with, then all the more reason, in planning to do anythingfurther in it or upon it, to “abhor that which is evil, and cleave tothat which is good.”and after such careful study, determine (before the first enthusiasthas an opportunity to put into some one window chosen at random a “mostsuperb” production of the much advertised glass man) determine inadvance what should be your total result when every window shall havebeen filled with stained glass: what story the whole shall tell, howbest its parts may be distributed, what each part shall be, in whatstyle, what design, what scale of drawing, scheme of color.and when this has been determined, in the fear of god, in sobernessof judgment, in conscientious fidelity to a sacred trust, with awillingness to be judged by a wiser posterity,――then let such a planbe adhered to as a law of the medes and persians which altereth not.to sacrifice one window to the seductions of some alien grandeur isto sacrifice the whole principle at stake. the plain glass patientlyawaiting its time to give way to the right thing is more eloquentof a truly reverent and truly artistic intention than a medley ofincongruous splendors.                   *       *       *       *       *and now, what is stained glass? this simple question it is of theutmost importance to answer, because a little familiarity with thematerials and the methods of workmanship will itself serve as a guideto the choice of good windows and to the avoidance of bad.stained glass, then, is simply glass which has been colored in the pot,glass which has its color within itself: while painted glass――a termsometimes used as synonymous with stained glass――is properly glasswhich has had the color painted upon its surface, and has then beenfired so that the colored or enameled surface has been vitrified. somestained glass is of so deep a color,――red, for instance――that a thincoating of it blown over the surface of a white (that is, colorless)glass is sufficient to produce the desired color effect; if the entirethickness of the pane were of the colored glass, the effect would bemuch too dark: such glass is nevertheless true stained glass, and iscalled “flashed.”in the early period of the art, beginning in the eleventh century andrunning parallel with the development of pointed (commonly calledgothic) architecture, only true stained glass was used. the use ofenamel paints applied to the surface to produce a different colormarks also the beginning of the decadence of the art; for the glory oftrue glass is in its jewel-like quality, its color being within itselfand all absolutely translucent, while a painted glass will always benecessarily dull in comparison. the temptation to paint color upon thesurface of glass is readily understood: it was an easier method, itpromised wider scope, greater variety, in a word, the opportunity tomake pictures somewhat as the painter may upon canvas. but glass isnot canvas, and church windows are not to be pictures. retribution hasovertaken this work, and the latest and most ambitious more speedilythan all; the enamel-painted glass has not stood the test of time,becoming muddy and perishing while the true ancient stained glass isstill the joy and wonder of all who gaze upon it.for, as we have said, the glory of true stained glass is in its rich,jewel-like color. its reds, which the makers called “ruby,” its blueswhich they called “sapphire,” with its “emerald” greens, its “gold” andits “pearl,” never entered the field to compete with the achievementsof the painter’s brush; to compare the delight they afford the beholderwith that derived from a painting would be in a sense as impossible asa comparison between the fragrance of a flower and the cadence of asong.the early makers of stained glass windows contended with great, tomoderns they would be intolerable, limitations. they were almostabsolutely restricted to the primary colors. they had not at first theart of blowing glass, but cast their pieces in small panes of at mostfour or five inches in diameter. the use of the diamond in cuttingwas not known till the sixteenth century. hence their work was simplymosaic. for variety they depended upon an arrangement of geometricalpatterns, or patterns of familiar architectural form and of commonecclesiastical symbols. to construct these they leaded together theirpieces and bits of glass, elaborating their treatment as time went on,but always in the main upon the same lines.when they began to portray, in panels on their windows, the forms ofour lord, of his apostles, of saints and angels, sometimes in crudesettings of scenes or incidents from holy scripture or church legend,their color principle was still the same; and it was still the samein the elaboration of the merely ornamental borders with forms ofleaf or flower or fruit, or of sacred emblems and inscriptions. thebrown pigment with which they produced faces and features, hands,feet, outlines and ornamentations, was not a color, nor intended fora color, but simply a means of definition or delineation when thiswas too minute to be carried out with leads. and the stained glassit was, still, which addressed the eye and compelled attention andadmiration. no more than in heraldry did the forms and emblems pretendto be pictures of the actual, realistic representations of men, or ofscenes or incidents. the makers of early stained glass were, in oneword, simply makers of ornamental windows of rich color and religioussymbolism.we have said that their pieces of glass were small. this is but to saythat their windows were a network of leads. for there is but one way tohold together such pieces of glass in a window, and that is by leads.these leads are not a misfortune. a square yard of simple red stainedglass is artistically more beautiful if composed of a hundred piecesleaded together than if it were in a single sheet. the differencesin texture themselves produce a better result, and the black leads,scarcely discernible individually, contribute an additional elementof pleasure. and in arranging pieces of different color side by side,intelligent leading design was itself the artist’s drawing, andeffected results altogether admirable. so far was this art of leadingcarried in france, for instance, that windows mainly of white glasswere produced, of rare beauty by simple virtue of their structuraldesign.all this was changed by the men who in a later age ground up theirenamel pigments, glazed windows in large panes, and daubed upon themtheir muddy colors, with a sublime contempt for the crude laboriousmosaic work of their predecessors. would they have a representationof the earth for their figure to stand upon? it must be carpetedwith grass, with green grass, and they can paint green grass upon acolorless surface; red flowers also, upon the same, with red paint, ifsuch were desired. the renaissance was coming; gothic was barbarousanyway; antiquated crudities must give place to refined work worthyof the new enlightenment! paint a picture on canvas, then paint thatpicture on your glass. it can be done, certainly, if you will not allowyourself to be bothered with the nuisance of leads, but just get anample pane of glass, unobstructed, and go at it with your brush andpaints!this miserable travesty did not long hold sway, it was scarcelypermitted to go its own theoretical length. there came great politicalchanges, great religious changes, and for a long time few churchesmore were built, nor even those standing kept in repair. the courseof ecclesiastical architecture suffered an interruption for severalcenturies, of which mr. ralph adams cram has told us feelingly in hisrecent writings on that subject.                   *       *       *       *       *but within the memory of men now living there has also come thebeginning of a true revival. the awakening of the catholic spiritin the anglican communion has been accompanied by an eager desire torecover lost treasures and to restore sound traditions to their formerhonor.and naturally all this has shown itself in the cultivation of stainedglass also. as we have said, what is needed above all else isknowledge, to guide us to what is really good and worthy.no sooner is any want of the public made evident than enterprisingtrade springs up to supply that want. if you want colored churchwindows, you can have them to-day at a trifle per square yard bypurchasing a beautifully printed paper, of genuine ecclesiasticaldesign, and pasting it upon your present windows. from this mostabysmal horror of vulgarity you may pass through various successivegradations of so-called stained glass, all supplied by trade. if youpass on to the costliest, you are not thereby sure to obtain what isnot horrible and vulgar, when regarded from the point of view of truestained glass, of architectural art, and of religion.there are at this moment three rather diverse schools of stainedglass most in evidence before those who seek and are willing to payfor honest art work; the english, the german, and the american. theircomparative merits are nowhere, to our knowledge, presented in a fairminded way; the makers of each claim superior excellence for theirown, of course; if, indeed, they ever intimate to the public that thereis any other kind at all. it should be said, however, that there isgreat merit in the best examples of each school; and that none of theseschools can fairly be judged by the inferior stuff which is put outunder its name, for each of them is defamed by such stuff.the english school naturally had, and still has, great prestige amongchurchmen. taking it at its best, as for instance in the work ofmr. henry holiday, it is simple and vigorous in drawing, varied andharmonious in color, churchly in spirit, while free from mediævalism.the english artist believes in stained glass, glass which has its colorwithin itself; and good glass, the best he can obtain. his glass isflat, that is, of even surface and equal thickness. he believes inpainting upon this glass, and upon, one may say, every piece and bitof it; but he does not paint a color upon it, he simply shades it,draws folds of drapery, patterns of fabrics, details of ornamentations;always, however, aiming to leave it, however much so painted, withthe color of the glass gleaming and glittering: that is, he does notdaub over the surface, but puts on mere lines, and picks out lights,so that his painted piece of green glass, let us say, is still greenglass, only with design upon it, or texture, or light and shade. hefeels that only in this way has he done all which as an artist he isconscientiously bound to do; and he accounts a piece of mere stainedglass which has not felt the brush at all, which has not had the touchof the conscious art of the maker, a poor thing, in a sort, crude andbarbaric.in the hands of a master――and there have been great masters in theenglish school――the results of this method have been very fine. buteven so the fact remains that every line and every particle of evenneutral pigment upon the surface of glass obscures so much light; whichis to say, it detracts so much from its brilliancy and splendor. thefact is undeniable that the total effect of some great window of thisschool will be charming, but withal just a little dull; the richnesswhich gleams and glitters from it is yet half hidden as by somefluttering veil before it. such work at its best is exquisite; it isdevotional; it is soothing; but hardly gives one a thrill of gladness.in the hands of a master, it is a fit medium for strong individualityof a good kind, as witness burne-jones’ windows executed at the worksof william morris. in the hands of the common multitude of englishmakers, it degenerates into a wearisome, conventional repetition ofstiff figures, draped in the same damask stuffs, with the same woodenlittle flowers growing up around their feet, the whole surrounded bythe same easily managed conventional border.of the german glass, commonly called munich glass, it is sufficient forour purpose to say that it is in principle the same as the english.it relies much upon the brush. it is more in the mediæval spiritthan the english; its feeling is that of a simply traditional, not amodern, devoutness. its inspiration is italian. its colors are morepredominatingly the old primary colors. its decorative features arestrictly conventional, and applied in a mechanical spirit. in warmth,in splendor of color, german windows at their best are superior to theenglish.american glass is not simply glass made in america. the term denotes anew method, which yet is, in the main, a restoration of the very oldestmethod, reinforced on its own lines by modern resources. mr. john lafarge is its distinguished pioneer.american glass is true stained glass; but it is not glass of evensurface and of equal thickness.[a] by its inequality of thicknessthe american artist effects what the english artist accomplishes bybrushing dark lines upon his even glass; or he leads strips and piecesof glass on the back of his window to intensify and deepen his color,as in folds of drapery and the like. he paints nothing except faces,hands and feet; all the rest he binds himself to obtain by the mosaicmethod. he cannot obtain by the mosaic method everything that theenglish artist obtains by the brush; but he feels that he obtains allwhich in a window is necessary, and by patient, thoroughly artisticwork he obtains what upon study proves marvelous; and he has all hisglass free to exhibit the full glory of glass. his very necessitiescompel him to compose in the true way, that is by lead lines; he isback upon first principles in this respect. the lead lines mark thestructural lines of his drawing. but he has still to contend with thenecessity of painting his flesh parts; and of overcoming the breakbetween their flatness, between the dull hardness of painted faces,hands and feet, and the splendid jewel-like strength of all the restof his window. the best he can do is to make this transition as littleabrupt as possible.[a] the earliest glass was not glass of even surface and equalthickness. therein lies one of its charms.needless to say, the american school has its dangers. the ease withwhich an ignorant eye may be imposed upon by great pieces of foldedglass instead of conscientiously selected and leaded strips and pieces,is a snare, into which it is not necessary for an honest artist tofall. when, however, a customer demands something cheap, he can obtainit in so-called american glass, and it will be cheap enough. there hasbeen also a deplorable tendency among some prominent american glassmakers toward startling theatrical effects. of unchurchly windows,windows hopelessly and utterly unchurchly, the great majority doubtlessare of the american school; nor are they the windows which have costthe least money. novel and indescribable colors, as far removed aspossible from all sober, reverent, devotional feeling, have beenemployed; effects have been sought which actually destroy all the valueof the window as what it was designed by its architect, a window ina sacred edifice. and by the wide heralding of such performances, asif american glass meant simply this sort of thing, american glass hasforfeited that just appreciation which in its essential principles itso richly merits. let the american school remember that a window ina church is and forever must remain just a window, subservient thatis, to the architecture of the church; let it design in the spirit ofworshipful, reverent, dignified, sober devotion; let it compose withtechnical conscientiousness and love its leads and spare no labor;let it choose thoroughly good glass, and glass of predominantly theglorious colors so long honorable, eschewing startling and meretriciouseffects: and there will, to our mind, be no doubt of its being thestained glass of the future.but, to our thinking, one thing cannot safely be done; and that is theplacing of english and american, or munich and american glass side byside in the same building. let it be the one or the other; when youhave chosen which it shall be, adhere to that. to mingle the schoolsin the same edifice will be sure to prove fatal to the best effects ofeach.and before placing any permanent stained glass, again let us say, studythe subject; see all the windows you can; and make haste slowly.[illustration]                         stained glass windows                      for grace church, lockport.                a report to the vestry of the parish by                     its rector, january , .after many months of inquiry, reflection, special study, and suchvisits to churches as opportunity afforded, we are at last in aposition to bring together the facts bearing upon this importantproject, and to submit the results for your consideration.grace church,[b] lockport, is an edifice which though not striking orornate, is in point of architectural merit, of conspicuous importancein the community, in probable permanence and enduring interest secondto none in our city. erected more than forty years ago, of stone, itsinterior chastely beautified and enriched at successive periods; itsnave alone over one hundred feet long, forty-six feet wide, fiftyfeet high; its lofty chancel with a window twenty-two feet in height,nearly ten feet in width: it impresses the educated eye on enteringit as beautiful and churchly, characterized by simple grace andreverent dignity, and the exclusion of the tawdry and incongruous. wemay honestly admit some faults. what building, religious or other,is without them? but it is a church which grows upon us the longerwe worship in it; it becomes homelike to us, and yet excites ouradmiration the more as we become better acquainted with it.[b] the design was one of richard upjohn’s.this is the building which is committed to our care. not only thatwe keep it clean and in repair, warmed and lighted, not only thatwe preserve the fabric as a valuable piece of property; but thatcontinuing to labor in the spirit of those who have preceded us, wesecure such further additions to it as will tend to make it complete inits kind.we say, complete in its kind. and it is our sacred duty, therefore,to understand what it is that we already have, as well as to ask whatfurther gifts and further embellishments might add thereto. for toadd, with the best intention and with lavish generosity, but withoutan understanding of the conditions and limitations imposed by theexisting edifice, might easily result in such disastrous incongruityas a future generation, if not ours, would deplore. the land is fullof warning examples, and one is at times appalled to think of the vastsums embodied in worse than waste, from which our better educateddescendants after us will suffer in the years to come. knowledge isbound to grow; travel and study cannot fail to make an understanding ofthese things the common property of intelligent church people as timegoes on. and it is a grave responsibility to be at the head of a parishin which permanent work is undertaken and executed, work on which thefuture is to pronounce judgment. this responsibility, let me add, yourrector for one feels very seriously and deeply.a very common form of architectural enrichment in this day of growingwealth and of increasing commemoration of the departed is that ofstained glass windows. no memorial can be more beautiful than this whenwisely planned and well executed. none can be much more painful orincessantly offensive when inartistic, incongruous, or lacking in thetrue devotional spirit.and as touching our own case, it is reasonably certain that offers willbe made to place such windows in grace church. it would be ungenerousto decline them. moreover, we cannot escape the moral obligation ofdirecting what such memorials shall be, so far as the building itself,its style of architecture, its uses, and its history, shall impose theconditions. it is not a question of dictating to intending donors: forthe vestry to decline to exercise such control would be for us to failof a sacred trust.our church, we may be most thankful to bear in mind, is built in astyle pure and self-consistent, plain as it is. it is early english, ofthe first and simplest of the periods of gothic. to treat it as if itwere of some other style, in any changes or additions we might see fitto make hereafter, would be to do violence to the edifice, to wrong itsintelligent and loving builders in the days of good bishop de lancey,and those who shall inherit it after we are gone. there is meaning andpurpose in it, as it is: in every line of it, in every arch, everydimension, every grouping and distribution of parts.we are not at liberty, therefore, to change the window openings, insize or form, unless indeed we wish to rebuild the church. we may atour taste reconstruct the windows in the houses in which we live, butwe cannot alter the style of these windows without destroying the styleof the architecture. the series of long narrow lancets, no matter howlong or how narrow, are right; and with all their severe simplicity,their beauty of outline and their grace and dignity grow upon one themore they are studied. mediæval builders had a meaning even in puttingsuch windows in pairs; it may seem to us a little fantastic, but asthey made everything symbolical, so in this grouping they symbolizedour lord’s sending out his apostles two and two. apart from such aconsideration, there is a quiet grace in this long succession oflancet pairs which may safely be left to speak for itself.the development of window forms is itself very interesting, and shouldbe understood before an attempt is made to treat any church windowsin particular. mrs. van rensselaer, who has done so much to make theenglish cathedrals known in this country, thus traces the successivesteps from style to style: “fancy first a plain tall window with around-arched head; then the round exchanged for a pointed head; thentwo, or three, or five perhaps, of these pointed windows set closetogether; and then a projecting moulding in the shape of an arch drawnaround them, including them all and thus including, of necessity, aplain piece of wall above their heads. then fancy this piece of wallpierced with a few small openings, and we have a group of connectedlights in which, as a plant in its embryo, lies the promise of allafter-development....“the small lights in the upper field enlarge and multiply until theyform a connected pattern which fills its whole area, and the jambs ofthe main lights diminish into narrow strips or very slender columns.the great arch, which in the first place did but encircle the windows,thus becomes itself the window――the ‘plate-traceried’ window which wasrichly developed in early french gothic, but less richly in english,owing to the persistent local love for mere groups of lancets. thenall the stone-work shrinks still farther――the columnar character ofthe uprights is lost, and the flat surfaces between the upper openingschange into mouldings of complex section. thus the original talllights and upper piercings surrender their last claim to independence;the uprights are no longer jambs or bits of wall but mullions, thearch-head is filled with genuine traceries, and all the elements of thedesign are vitally fused together within the sweep of the great windowto form its multiple yet organic beauty.”the art of making stained glass windows went hand in hand with thisdevelopment of architectural forms through the eleventh, twelfth,thirteenth and succeeding centuries. it has indeed been calledthe “principal branch of mediæval art;” but was always treated asabsolutely subservient to the particular architecture itself. a mosteminent authority denies that the art of glass-staining has ever beenlost. glass itself was used by christians in their churches from theearliest church-building times; the distinct art of painting on glassemerges, one might say, with the springing up of pointed architecture,though the beginnings show themselves in norman architecture in theeleventh century. four centuries the two arts flourished side byside; with the decadence of the greater came also the decline of thesubsidiary; a poorer taste in building was naturally accompaniedby a poorer taste in glass. with the revival of interest in thoselong-neglected periods of noble achievement, the oxford movement ofchurch restoration giving men the religious guiding principles for anintelligent appreciation of the forms of mediæval art, church buildingand glass staining were brought back again, the one with the other. andwhether such restoration can leave us satisfied with the mere recoveryof the riches of by-gone ages, or must mean also, as i believe, thedevelopment of what the present can contribute in a reverent but notslavish spirit――certain it is that the first step is to understand thepast, to find out what was done in the great formative and classicperiods, why it was done as it was and not otherwise, in a word, tomaster the models before we proceed on our own course; and, as i saidbefore, to remember to which period and style our own edifice belongs.it was my good fortune when recently in the city of philadelphia, toobtain access to a rare work over which i spent some very delightfulhours. its author was a william warrington, himself a designer andproducer of windows, and a reverent student of ancient examples, whopublished his great folio in london, in . from him i learned manythings about the beginnings and progress of the art. great were thedifficulties of the eleventh century pioneers. they had to contendwith defective methods of manufacture; not understanding glass-blowingthey fused their glass in pots and crucibles, and cast it to aboutthe required shape, in pieces not more than four or five inches indiameter. cutting with the diamond was not known till the sixteenthcentury. they designed and made and erected their own work. whengreat orders were to be executed, artists were brought together fromthe different countries, and by a sort of “free-masonry” they workedtogether in perfect agreement as to styles, rules, and principles.in the course of time, different countries produced slightly differingschools.as in heraldry, the colors of the glass were intended for colors ofprecious stones; the representations of figures and objects were notmeant to be pictures, but being also strictly symbolical, the drawingwas conventional, with no intention to reproduce nature in color, orform, or position and perspective. the figures which excite ridiculeon the part of one who is without the clue, justify themselves by thisprinciple; nor is it quite true to say the men of that time did notknow how to draw――their ability in this respect was not that of artiststo-day, but if their object had been to produce a figure or a scene forthe sole purpose of a picture, they might certainly and would certainlyhave given us something very different from what they did. while thesmall separate pieces are often very minutely pencilled, all such workbeing afterward burned in――there is no “shadowing,” as in a picture,supposing the light to fall from a certain direction; but a kind of“relief” shading, making the view suitable to any aspect. in a word,the drawing is the same as in mss., tapestries and heraldic designs.ruby and sapphire were the ground colors. and in all the work theprimitive colors were adhered to.in york minister there is to be found the largest and finest specimenof thirteenth century glass in england in a group of lancets knownas the “five sisters.” the lancets are each six feet wide and fiftyfeet high, and each divided into thirteen compartments or squaresof different patterns. their designs being largely of an ornamentalcharacter, they escaped destruction by the puritans.it is a curious fact that english stained glass at no time had largefigures. in the thirteenth century continental art in this respectdiverged from ancient and english, under italian influence.in the cathedral of bourges there are one hundred and eighty-threestained glass windows, executed from the thirteenth century downwards.the early lancets have figures occupying the larger part of the window,sometimes fifteen or twenty feet high; over each figure a sort ofcanopy or tabernacle disproportionately small, and under it a kind ofpedestal or base about a foot high. around the margin is the finestwork in the windows, in a broad band of mosaic.cologne cathedral has four lancets each eleven times its width inheight, filled with early glass of this period; the figures in thewindows are in height one-third the height of the lancet, with a canopyabove them.the developments of the centuries following are of less interest to ourpresent purpose. suffice it to say that even in the rich decoratedstyle of architecture the treatment of individual windows was not whatwe might term ambitious: the effect was secured by not attemptingtoo much in a single window, but by producing a rich harmony withsubordination of each to the whole. in the perpendicular style whichfollowed, in the fifteenth century, while there was a very abundantproduction of glass, its quality was inferior, and much white glass wasused. figures with canopies were used when the single openings wereone foot wide and upward; panels, when they were considerably larger;and to fill the extreme length, story upon story. and there begins toappear a tendency to conform the glass less to the architecture itself.from the sixteenth century on there is marked decay. the attempts totreat glass like canvas prove an entire failure. a voluptuous andsensual school of painting came in, debasing a religious art, whichthus became secularized, and almost disappeared. the destruction offine ancient examples in the puritan revolution left england very poor,and the little that remained came to be less and less appreciated.curiously enough, large importations of glass consequent on the frenchrevolution with its destruction of churches, put into the hands ofenglish churchmen what the religious revival of the church soontaught them to appreciate once more, and so it is that to-day englandis enriching her cathedrals and churches with restorations and newwindows; and from her the impulse has naturally come to our own landalso. but the production of stained glass is in america of very recentdate.from facts like the foregoing we may conclude that the subject is oneof importance and involving so much that it is well that we shouldproceed cautiously in the placing of stained glass in grace church.but shall we encourage such a movement at all?it seems to me that this is the moment supremely opportune for us toinaugurate a scheme of window treatment such as shall glorify our houseof god more and more till it reaches completion. how long it may taketo reach completion is in a sense immaterial. that we should begin now,and make every step a right one, is the great matter.the practical question is, shall we choose to admit one or a fewstriking windows into this edifice, windows which may have no relationto each other, produced possibly by methods or on principles entirelyat variance, in color-schemes discordant, in scale of drawing entirelydissimilar and unequal: or shall we guide intending donors to suchgifts as shall be a satisfaction and a delight forever, beautifuleach in itself, but more beautiful still when assembled? this i takeit is the question. for i believe windows will be placed, whether weencourage it or not, within a decade, possibly much sooner. and wheni put the question thus, it appears to me there is but one answerpossible.let us then get down to the practical details in the matter. leavingthe great chancel window entirely out of consideration, we have fivepairs of lancets of equal size on either side of the nave, and a sixth,smaller pair over the doors in continuation of the series up to thechancel. we have further, the magnificent group of three lancets at thefoot of the nave, with a fourth lancet a little smaller, and still muchlarger than those in the pairs already referred to.here is a considerable number of windows――twenty-nine when we countin the chancel window; what an opportunity for discord and artisticanarchy! let us say, rather, what a remarkable and rare opportunity forthe production of a rich and hallowed splendor, fitted not only toexpress the consecration of man’s gifts to god, but to instruct theminds and quicken the devotions of generations to come.the objection which most readily offers itself when stained glass isproposed for grace church is that the twenty lancets at the sides areso extremely narrow and so very high that nothing can be done withthem. if by ‘doing something’ is meant putting in scenes with severalor many figures, it is most true. the breadth of wall between the twowindows constituting the pair is so large that the scene could not becarried from the one to the other. but surely that does not exhaust thepossibilities. the openings are wide enough to permit the treatment ofsingle figures in full life-size if desired; figures with canopies,borders, and panels at the base, as in the best periods of ancientglass. the breadth of these openings is twenty-one inches; six inchesmore than that of the small pair erected all saints, , at the sideof the pulpit, in which the figures are certainly of dignified stature,and by no means poor in back ground and accessories. if such resultsare possible in a space fifteen inches wide and six feet high; how muchmore in a space twenty-one inches wide and thirteen feet high.single figures, therefore, are demanded by the conditions which governus, for the side lancets; unless we rest content with geometrical,or flower windows, or windows bearing emblems, more or less ornatelybordered. i venture to say that at this stage of our history, whenwe are not pressed to fill our window-openings with whatever may beobtainable, we desire the best that can be had. this best, for the sidelancets is,――single figures, with canopy, border and base panel.mr. f. s. lamb of new york, who designed the beautiful work erecteda year ago, has prepared and sent me two pairs of colored sketches,suggesting a noble and beautiful form which in the execution would, ofcourse, far surpass what appears in the drawings. they are submittedfor your careful study, and may be seen at any time in my library.what then shall the figures be? shall they be chosen at random?artistically speaking, this might not be so disastrous, provided thesame artist drew all the designs and controlled the execution, so thatthe scale of drawing and the scheme of color were kept in accord. andthat is a great deal more than can be said of some of the principalchurches in our greatest cities, where immense sums have been spent onthese works. no; there is something better still, open to us. it is aserial treatment, with unity, and progress: so that the whole, whencomplete, shall tell one great story, each part a chapter therein;the whole impress one truth, each part contributing somewhat to thecumulative force of the great lesson.and, not to detain you with all the processes of thought and longreflection by which at last we reach our conclusion――the figures wesuggest are those which are conspicuous and representative in theold and new testaments. our divine lord himself should be, as he is,exalted in the great window over the altar. beginning from the angleof the chancel arch to pass around the church, we come first to thepair of small windows next to the organ, from which now the light isexcluded by the parish building. they may be taken as in a sense goingwith the organ, and scarcely a part of the general scheme. let thembe treated, at some time, in mosaic, with singing angels,[c] thuscorresponding to the angels directly opposite in the correspondingsmall windows. then we pass to the first pair of lancets of uniformsize, melchizedek and abraham: the latter the great father of thefaithful, the head of the covenant people; the former even superiorto him, a priest forever, without beginning or end of days, type ofour lord’s own highpriesthood. melchizedek appears before abraham,bearing bread and wine, foreshadowing of the holy eucharist. what moresuitable, as we look up to the altar and see above it the figure of ourblessed lord, than to turn to the head of the nave, and find here, atthe dawn of religious history, standing out as type of the christ inwhom the course of the ages shall culminate, this king of salem at thevery beginning?[c] recently placed.we pass on. the next pair will be moses and samuel: both conspicuousas appointed of god to lead, to rule, to judge the people whom god hadchosen; founders of israel as a nation. surely these, if any, we mustcommemorate as among the greatest in the covenant history.this brings us to the third or middle pair. woman, too, bears herconspicuous part in the spiritual history of mankind. deborah[d] judgedisrael for forty years in a period of disorder and confusion, and ledthe way to victory: ruth,[d] a very different type, beautiful andgentle, became one of that line of whom david, and david’s greater son,were born. other women might have been chosen, as well as other men;but on the whole, none more typical, none better fitted to instruct andto impress.[d] now in place.the fourth pair continues the narrative. david and elijah, each sostriking in his way, bring back the kingdom in its glory and thekingdom in its disaster; religion sweetly ministrant with music, andreligion sternly denouncing national sin; the royal harp, and theprophetic mantle.and finally, the fifth pair on this side, isaiah and malachi: thegreatest of all the prophets, called the evangelist of the oldtestament; and the last of seers, who most clearly foretold bothmessiah and forerunner.thus we arrive at one of the entrances, and turning the corner, westand before the first of the windows at the lower end. it is largeenough to admit more than one figure. it continues the story frommalachi, to him who went before the face of the lord: it presents to usst. john the baptist,[e] baptizing at jordan; and close by it standsthe font with its summons, as of old, to the washing away of sins.[e] to be erected in the near future.a splendid opportunity is presented by the great group next in order,the three associated windows piercing the end wall of the nave.majestic in their simple dignity of outline, what will they not bewhen filled with stained glass as they should be? here is space,indeed――ample room for that scene treatment of which the side-wallwindows are incapable.let the middle one, which is much the largest, be the nativity;[f]that on the right side (next to st. john baptist) the presentation inthe temple,[f] with simeon’s nunc dimittis; that on the left side, theepiphany,[f] with the gifts of the magi. thus will this entire end-wallset forth the incarnation, up to which the old testament has led us,and out of which proceeds the new, and all the history of the christianchurch.[f] now in place.turning again, and passing on, back once more toward the chancel,the first and second pairs of lancets on the cottage street side aredevoted to the four evangelists, sts. matthew, mark, luke and john. noexplanation is needed of the propriety of putting these figures here.not only as the biographers of the lord jesus christ, but as chieffounders of that church which is builded upon historic facts――men ofdeeds as well as writers――we commemorate them.the middle pair is again given to two great women of the new testament,mothers both and as mothers supremely great: st. elizabeth[g] and st.mary.[g] of the son of the first one it was said, among those born ofwomen there hath not appeared a greater than john. to the other theangel’s word was, hail, thou that are highly favored: the lord is withthee; and blessed art thou among women. no two characters can lay moreclaim to our gratitude and reverence than these two women to whom anallwise god entrusted the tender formative years of the forerunner andof the messiah.there is indeed a glorious company of apostles, and a noble army ofmartyrs, whom one would gladly set forth, two and two, in goodlysuccession. two pairs must suffice us: first st. andrew[g] and st.stephen;[g] next st. peter[g] and st. paul.[g] we begin with st.andrew, for he readily obeyed the calling of christ and followed himwithout delay, bringing his brother also: type of self-devotion andpersonal service, forever. st. stephen, set apart for the church’scharitable work, filled with the holy ghost and a mighty preacher,――hewas the first deacon, and became the first martyr. st. peter and st.paul bring us to a climax in the church’s realization of the greatcommission; prince apostles, the former first led to the gentiles butafterward distinctly charged with the gospel to the circumcision; thelatter sent out to the uncircumcision, truest champion of a catholicfaith and uncompromising leader of a catholic church. he brings us, aswe pass the two angel figures over the door, up to the pulpit,――whofitter than he to be set always before the preacher?――and thence againwe see before us the altar and the figure of our blessed lord fromwhich we started on our circuit;[g] now in place.    “christ is the end, for christ was the beginning:     christ the beginning, and the end is christ.”this is the scheme which is hereby recommended to your attentiveconsideration, your criticism, and if worthy, your adoption. whenadopted, each opening will be available only for the subject assignedto it, treated in the best style, under the direction and approvalof the vestry. windows may be erected in any order, provided theseconditions are complied with; though it is highly desirable that notless than a pair――where there are pairs――should be placed at a time.it is immaterial how many persons join in donating a window. the useof the windows for memorials is very beautiful and very desirable; butthere is no restriction to such use, by anything in the scheme.and in closing let it be added, that if――as undoubtedly they will――thevestry and parish shall feel sincerely thankful to those whoparticipate in this pious work, it is not there that the gratitudeshould chiefly lie. it is an unspeakable privilege to be permittedto place a memorial like this in the house of god, bringing ever newcomfort and joy to hearts bereaved, and satisfaction to the donors;yes, if there is need to say it, it is an honor to be permitted to doit. moreover, in the nature of the case, it is a privilege very limitedas to the number of those who can be so favored; and with every windowthat is taken, the number remaining available becomes rapidly less.                   *       *       *       *       *the above report

on stained glass windows for grace church lockport new yorkauthor: william frederic faberrelease date: november , [ebook #]language: englishproduced by: donald cummings and the online distributed proofreading team at https://www.pgdp.net (this file was produced from images generously made available by the internet archive)*** start of the project gutenberg ebook stained glass windows *** stained glass windows an essay with a report to the vestry on stained glass windows for grace church lockport new york [illustration] by william frederic faber [illustration] [illustration] lockport new york mcm note.the first edition of the _report on stained glass windows for gracechurch, lockport_, which appeared in january, , is now exhausted;as there is a constant demand for it, a second is deemed necessary; andthe occasion seemed favorable for a little further talk about windowsand glass. hence this pamphlet.the project of four years ago is no longer an insubstantial dream.since that time eleven windows and three mosaics have been placed ingrace church; in them all the adopted scheme has been followed, withresults more and more obviously satisfactory.although intending this pamphlet, in the first instance, simply fora guide to his own people, to lead them to a more discriminatingappreciation: the author is encouraged to hope, by many expressionsfrom the outside, that it will, even more than the earlier _report_, beof service beyond his parish; that it may perhaps stimulate elsewherealso a study of church glass, and the erection of true church windows. w. f. f.grace church rectory, lockport, all saints’, . stained glass windows.the subject is certainly one of present interest. the advertisements offirms who produce stained glass windows are numerous and conspicuousin our church weeklies; glowing accounts of memorials just erected inthis place and that make up a large part of our “diocesan news.” tosay nothing of the fact that we are in danger of forgetting what thereal business of the church is,――that it is not primarily to build andbeautify edifices, but to save men and to establish righteousness inthe earth; the uncomfortable question is forced upon us: for how muchof this “embellishment” of our churches will posterity thank us?a revival of religious art we welcome with profound gratitude. but whenfor the moment it threatens to take the form of an epidemic of stainedglass, our joy may be turned to apprehension. stained glass is simplybecoming fashionable; everybody is beginning to want some of it because‘all the other churches are getting some;’ commercial enterprisestimulates a well-meaning zeal, taking advantage, too, of a vulgarspirit of rivalry; and the end thereof must be painful to contemplate.individuals are often given a free hand in god’s house on the groundthat thus several hundred or several thousand dollars will be securedfor “enrichment;” and so the work goes merrily on.and such things can be because there is a lack of knowledge. personsmay have the best intention in the world; their experience in other,different fields may have been very wide; in a general way they mayhave good taste; moreover, they may possess a long purse and a liberaldisposition; perhaps they may think to save themselves from going wrongby putting the whole matter into the hands of strongly advertisedwindow-makers. but none of these things will supply the lack of aknowledge of stained glass. there is nothing for it but study andeducation. the clergy first of all, and after them the vestries, mustinform themselves on the subject as thoroughly as possible. in themeantime, let them be slow to lend themselves to anything which theylater, or those who come after them, might bitterly deplore and behelpless to remedy.nor is it to-day so forbidding a task to get this knowledge as itwas but a few years ago. then one had to go to the libraries in ourlargest cities, and laboriously gather from rare works the historyand principles of this art. now there is fortunately at least onesingle volume, easily obtainable, which may serve as a text-book toall who desire to study the subject. mr. lewis f. day has given us inhis _windows: a book about stained and painted glass_, published inlondon, , by b. t. batsford, imported by the scribners, just thatinformation which is needed. no vestry that has the matter of stainedglass memorials before it should permit its rector to be without thisbook; he should read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest it; but not heonly; they also, at least the members of any committee responsiblefor such work; and intending donors likewise, who desire to have acontrolling voice in regard to memorials to be erected. this is tooimportant a thing to enter upon recklessly or at the dictation of merefancy. * * * * *meanwhile it may not be out of place to tell briefly and simply whatstained glass windows in a church ought to be; and what stained glassitself is.stained glass windows are still, after all, windows: and windows areessential component parts of a building. if in a church, the axiomapplies the more inevitably: a church is a building presumed to conformrigidly to a certain type; and therefore, the idea which the whole isto exhibit and impress must not for a moment be hidden or dissipated byany component part.our dwelling houses may be often built in a haphazard way, with aview simply to utility, regardless of style, laying no claim toarchitectural art. but to build a church so is an offense, an offenseto art, and, we believe, an offense to religion also. a church buildingis presumed and expected to have a certain character, technicallycalled “style,” dignifying and elevating god’s house above our commonhouses, even though it be small and plain and not costly; smalland plain it may be, and not costly, but it must not be tawdry orincongruous or mean.now a window is, as we have said, a component part of the building.in a church well conceived, the window is inevitable just as it is:to make it larger or smaller, to close one up where now there is oneor to make one where there is none, is just so far to do violence tothe building. if such a change does not violate the integrity of thebuilding as a whole, the fact simply goes to show that the building hadno plan worthy of honor.the window-space is therefore always to be preserved for windowuse――just such and just so much as the architect gave us. the use of awindow (barring for the moment the unscientific one of ventilation) isto give light while still affording shelter. and this light-space isalso to serve artistically as a kind of balance to the dark space ofthe solid wall; hence this light-space is to art sacred, and must bepermitted to the end to assert itself as just what it is and such as itis, so much rightly apportioned and correctly proportioned translucentwall-space.when this window-space has been first filled with a plain glass, whichis then to give way to stained glass, the new treatment must say, justas obviously, only more beautifully, what the old said: it must stillbe a window――letting in light, though now the light is colored――and inits architectural value it must be just what it was before, assertingthe shape and the design of the structural window, plainly andfaithfully.in other words, the true stained glass window――in a church buildingworthy of that name――is not now to give the beholder the impressionthat he is looking out through an opening and seeing, of somethingbeyond, so much as the size of the opening will permit: in a word, thespectacular impression of looking into some beautiful out-door worldthrough a hole in the wall. the beholder must be conscious still oflooking at the wall itself, the translucent part of it, which confineshim within the edifice as much as the stone or the brick. nor yet isthe true stained glass window merely a colored glass picture coveringso much wall area: the outline form is to be so obvious, and thetreatment so non-realistic, that the architectural idea may never for amoment be in danger of submersion under some other idea.for, as is true in general of decorative art as contrasted withpictorial art, the true church window is to be designed withoutperspective, without shadow, without attempt at realistic effect. it isto be conventional, symbolical; with that intent it may utilize as itwill forms, colors, attitudes, postures, accessories, fearless of thecriticism that ‘this saint or that scene never in the world looked likethat.’ no intelligent person standing before decorative painting wouldfor a moment think of demanding a representation of the actual. that,frankly, was not its object.and the stained glass church window will further fulfill its particularend if all round the figure or group, or whatever be the subject matterof the composition, there runs a clear line or border of differentlycolored glass, making a clear demarcation from the stone wall; drawingagain, as it were, the architect’s line of his window construction.all of which is but to say that windows were made for the sake of thebuilding, and so must remain; not that a building was made for thesake of windows,――for the sake of furnishing so much space for somany square yards of somebody’s beautiful glass. which ought to beself-evident, though to many persons it is not. * * * * *so regarding it now, the further question naturally occurs as to thetreatment of the several windows of one particular church. for, eachindividual window might be in itself correct according to the aboveprinciples, and yet the total effect sadly lacking in unity and harmony.there is first of all the consideration of style: a difficult matterto define, yet not, after all, so difficult to determine. what oughtcertainly not to determine it is the chance ability of some wealthydonor or donors to pay for the costliest work that could be produced;nor, on the other hand, the limited ability of others who could giveonly something inexpensive. the style of the building and its generalcharacter must determine the degree of splendor and ornateness whichwill be right for each and all the windows. if there be wealth to dostill more, then exercise sober self-restraint. if there be availablemeans only to do part of what the building demands, better do just somuch as can be rightly and adequately done, though the scheme shouldwait many years for its entire completion. in building a new church,let this also be thought of in advance.then there is the question of a single scheme of subjects for all thewindows, so that all when completed shall tell, chapter by chapter,one great story, or part by part, one great truth: say, the christianfaith, or the redemption of man, or the sacramental economy of grace,or the history of religion, or the mission of the church in theworld. thus again, as in old time, will the church windows instructthe people, and the sum total of that instruction will be a unity,with harmony and interrelation of parts, of the utmost value to soundchristian thinking and feeling, and to symmetry of christian character.for it is just this which our modern religion so much lacks: the sadresult of sectarian thinking and teaching, where each hath a doctrine,a truth, and few the whole doctrine and the wholeness of truth.individualism, let us realize, is not what the church should foster:though individuality, in its rightful place, be precious and sacred.the application here is not fanciful. sadly absurd examples there are,where ecclesiastical art has been pressed into service by sectarianminds (not among the sects alone) to teach some one portion or fragmentof truth through the eye every time the eye gazed upon the interior ofthe house of worship and fell upon the favorite symbol or picture.but not this alone. individualism is rampant in our day in theform of utterly arbitrary choice of subjects, as well as of theirmode of treatment in point of material, color, scale of drawing,and――expensiveness. a babel of confusion is the result, and that insome of our foremost churches, which have become thereby rather picturegalleries or museums adapted to the study of all schools and alltastes, than restful, devotional, solemnizing and uplifting temples forthe worship of almighty god. a low motive ruled, and how can one helpfeeling it as one looks upon the performance?――here the wealthy donor,or the ambitious so-called artist, forgetting whose this house was,demanded worship for himself. “verily, they have their reward.”therefore let those who have such things in charge study first of allwhat a church should be, and then what their particular church, suchas they have received it in trust, is. it will often be found that abuilding very little esteemed has something to say for itself, andis worthy of respect as originally conceived, in its own structuralcharacter as designed by its architect. and if not, and if it mustbe borne with, then all the more reason, in planning to do anythingfurther in it or upon it, to “abhor that which is evil, and cleave tothat which is good.”and after such careful study, determine (before the first enthusiasthas an opportunity to put into some one window chosen at random a “mostsuperb” production of the much advertised glass man) determine inadvance what should be your total result when every window shall havebeen filled with stained glass: what story the whole shall tell, howbest its parts may be distributed, what each part shall be, in whatstyle, what design, what scale of drawing, scheme of color.and when this has been determined, in the fear of god, in sobernessof judgment, in conscientious fidelity to a sacred trust, with awillingness to be judged by a wiser posterity,――then let such a planbe adhered to as a law of the medes and persians which altereth not.to sacrifice one window to the seductions of some alien grandeur isto sacrifice the whole principle at stake. the plain glass patientlyawaiting its time to give way to the right thing is more eloquentof a truly reverent and truly artistic intention than a medley ofincongruous splendors. * * * * *and now, what is stained glass? this simple question it is of theutmost importance to answer, because a little familiarity with thematerials and the methods of workmanship will itself serve as a guideto the choice of good windows and to the avoidance of bad.stained glass, then, is simply glass which has been colored in the pot,glass which has its color within itself: while painted glass――a termsometimes used as synonymous with stained glass――is properly glasswhich has had the color painted upon its surface, and has then beenfired so that the colored or enameled surface has been vitrified. somestained glass is of so deep a color,――red, for instance――that a thincoating of it blown over the surface of a white (that is, colorless)glass is sufficient to produce the desired color effect; if the entirethickness of the pane were of the colored glass, the effect would bemuch too dark: such glass is nevertheless true stained glass, and iscalled “flashed.”in the early period of the art, beginning in the eleventh century andrunning parallel with the development of pointed (commonly calledgothic) architecture, only true stained glass was used. the use ofenamel paints applied to the surface to produce a different colormarks also the beginning of the decadence of the art; for the glory oftrue glass is in its jewel-like quality, its color being within itselfand all absolutely translucent, while a painted glass will always benecessarily dull in comparison. the temptation to paint color upon thesurface of glass is readily understood: it was an easier method, itpromised wider scope, greater variety, in a word, the opportunity tomake pictures somewhat as the painter may upon canvas. but glass isnot canvas, and church windows are not to be pictures. retribution hasovertaken this work, and the latest and most ambitious more speedilythan all; the enamel-painted glass has not stood the test of time,becoming muddy and perishing while the true ancient stained glass isstill the joy and wonder of all who gaze upon it.for, as we have said, the glory of true stained glass is in its rich,jewel-like color. its reds, which the makers called “ruby,” its blueswhich they called “sapphire,” with its “emerald” greens, its “gold” andits “pearl,” never entered the field to compete with the achievementsof the painter’s brush; to compare the delight they afford the beholderwith that derived from a painting would be in a sense as impossible asa comparison between the fragrance of a flower and the cadence of asong.the early makers of stained glass windows contended with great, tomoderns they would be intolerable, limitations. they were almostabsolutely restricted to the primary colors. they had not at first theart of blowing glass, but cast their pieces in small panes of at mostfour or five inches in diameter. the use of the diamond in cuttingwas not known till the sixteenth century. hence their work was simplymosaic. for variety they depended upon an arrangement of geometricalpatterns, or patterns of familiar architectural form and of commonecclesiastical symbols. to construct these they leaded together theirpieces and bits of glass, elaborating their treatment as time went on,but always in the main upon the same lines.when they began to portray, in panels on their windows, the forms ofour lord, of his apostles, of saints and angels, sometimes in crudesettings of scenes or incidents from holy scripture or church legend,their color principle was still the same; and it was still the samein the elaboration of the merely ornamental borders with forms ofleaf or flower or fruit, or of sacred emblems and inscriptions. thebrown pigment with which they produced faces and features, hands,feet, outlines and ornamentations, was not a color, nor intended fora color, but simply a means of definition or delineation when thiswas too minute to be carried out with leads. and the stained glassit was, still, which addressed the eye and compelled attention andadmiration. no more than in heraldry did the forms and emblems pretendto be pictures of the actual, realistic representations of men, or ofscenes or incidents. the makers of early stained glass were, in oneword, simply makers of ornamental windows of rich color and religioussymbolism.we have said that their pieces of glass were small. this is but to saythat their windows were a network of leads. for there is but one way tohold together such pieces of glass in a window, and that is by leads.these leads are not a misfortune. a square yard of simple red stainedglass is artistically more beautiful if composed of a hundred piecesleaded together than if it were in a single sheet. the differencesin texture themselves produce a better result, and the black leads,scarcely discernible individually, contribute an additional elementof pleasure. and in arranging pieces of different color side by side,intelligent leading design was itself the artist’s drawing, andeffected results altogether admirable. so far was this art of leadingcarried in france, for instance, that windows mainly of white glasswere produced, of rare beauty by simple virtue of their structuraldesign.all this was changed by the men who in a later age ground up theirenamel pigments, glazed windows in large panes, and daubed upon themtheir muddy colors, with a sublime contempt for the crude laboriousmosaic work of their predecessors. would they have a representationof the earth for their figure to stand upon? it must be carpetedwith grass, with green grass, and they can paint green grass upon acolorless surface; red flowers also, upon the same, with red paint, ifsuch were desired. the renaissance was coming; gothic was barbarousanyway; antiquated crudities must give place to refined work worthyof the new enlightenment! paint a picture on canvas, then paint thatpicture on your glass. it can be done, certainly, if you will not allowyourself to be bothered with the nuisance of leads, but just get anample pane of glass, unobstructed, and go at it with your brush andpaints!this miserable travesty did not long hold sway, it was scarcelypermitted to go its own theoretical length. there came great politicalchanges, great religious changes, and for a long time few churchesmore were built, nor even those standing kept in repair. the courseof ecclesiastical architecture suffered an interruption for severalcenturies, of which mr. ralph adams cram has told us feelingly in hisrecent writings on that subject. * * * * *but within the memory of men now living there has also come thebeginning of a true revival. the awakening of the catholic spiritin the anglican communion has been accompanied by an eager desire torecover lost treasures and to restore sound traditions to their formerhonor.and naturally all this has shown itself in the cultivation of stainedglass also. as we have said, what is needed above all else isknowledge, to guide us to what is really good and worthy.no sooner is any want of the public made evident than enterprisingtrade springs up to supply that want. if you want colored churchwindows, you can have them to-day at a trifle per square yard bypurchasing a beautifully printed paper, of genuine ecclesiasticaldesign, and pasting it upon your present windows. from this mostabysmal horror of vulgarity you may pass through various successivegradations of so-called stained glass, all supplied by trade. if youpass on to the costliest, you are not thereby sure to obtain what isnot horrible and vulgar, when regarded from the point of view of truestained glass, of architectural art, and of religion.there are at this moment three rather diverse schools of stainedglass most in evidence before those who seek and are willing to payfor honest art work; the english, the german, and the american. theircomparative merits are nowhere, to our knowledge, presented in a fairminded way; the makers of each claim superior excellence for theirown, of course; if, indeed, they ever intimate to the public that thereis any other kind at all. it should be said, however, that there isgreat merit in the best examples of each school; and that none of theseschools can fairly be judged by the inferior stuff which is put outunder its name, for each of them is defamed by such stuff.the english school naturally had, and still has, great prestige amongchurchmen. taking it at its best, as for instance in the work ofmr. henry holiday, it is simple and vigorous in drawing, varied andharmonious in color, churchly in spirit, while free from mediævalism.the english artist believes in stained glass, glass which has its colorwithin itself; and good glass, the best he can obtain. his glass isflat, that is, of even surface and equal thickness. he believes inpainting upon this glass, and upon, one may say, every piece and bitof it; but he does not paint a color upon it, he simply shades it,draws folds of drapery, patterns of fabrics, details of ornamentations;always, however, aiming to leave it, however much so painted, withthe color of the glass gleaming and glittering: that is, he does notdaub over the surface, but puts on mere lines, and picks out lights,so that his painted piece of green glass, let us say, is still greenglass, only with design upon it, or texture, or light and shade. hefeels that only in this way has he done all which as an artist he isconscientiously bound to do; and he accounts a piece of mere stainedglass which has not felt the brush at all, which has not had the touchof the conscious art of the maker, a poor thing, in a sort, crude andbarbaric.in the hands of a master――and there have been great masters in theenglish school――the results of this method have been very fine. buteven so the fact remains that every line and every particle of evenneutral pigment upon the surface of glass obscures so much light; whichis to say, it detracts so much from its brilliancy and splendor. thefact is undeniable that the total effect of some great window of thisschool will be charming, but withal just a little dull; the richnesswhich gleams and glitters from it is yet half hidden as by somefluttering veil before it. such work at its best is exquisite; it isdevotional; it is soothing; but hardly gives one a thrill of gladness.in the hands of a master, it is a fit medium for strong individualityof a good kind, as witness burne-jones’ windows executed at the worksof william morris. in the hands of the common multitude of englishmakers, it degenerates into a wearisome, conventional repetition ofstiff figures, draped in the same damask stuffs, with the same woodenlittle flowers growing up around their feet, the whole surrounded bythe same easily managed conventional border.of the german glass, commonly called munich glass, it is sufficient forour purpose to say that it is in principle the same as the english.it relies much upon the brush. it is more in the mediæval spiritthan the english; its feeling is that of a simply traditional, not amodern, devoutness. its inspiration is italian. its colors are morepredominatingly the old primary colors. its decorative features arestrictly conventional, and applied in a mechanical spirit. in warmth,in splendor of color, german windows at their best are superior to theenglish.american glass is not simply glass made in america. the term denotes anew method, which yet is, in the main, a restoration of the very oldestmethod, reinforced on its own lines by modern resources. mr. john lafarge is its distinguished pioneer.american glass is true stained glass; but it is not glass of evensurface and of equal thickness.[a] by its inequality of thicknessthe american artist effects what the english artist accomplishes bybrushing dark lines upon his even glass; or he leads strips and piecesof glass on the back of his window to intensify and deepen his color,as in folds of drapery and the like. he paints nothing except faces,hands and feet; all the rest he binds himself to obtain by the mosaicmethod. he cannot obtain by the mosaic method everything that theenglish artist obtains by the brush; but he feels that he obtains allwhich in a window is necessary, and by patient, thoroughly artisticwork he obtains what upon study proves marvelous; and he has all hisglass free to exhibit the full glory of glass. his very necessitiescompel him to compose in the true way, that is by lead lines; he isback upon first principles in this respect. the lead lines mark thestructural lines of his drawing. but he has still to contend with thenecessity of painting his flesh parts; and of overcoming the breakbetween their flatness, between the dull hardness of painted faces,hands and feet, and the splendid jewel-like strength of all the restof his window. the best he can do is to make this transition as littleabrupt as possible.[a] the earliest glass was not glass of even surface and equalthickness. therein lies one of its charms.needless to say, the american school has its dangers. the ease withwhich an ignorant eye may be imposed upon by great pieces of foldedglass instead of conscientiously selected and leaded strips and pieces,is a snare, into which it is not necessary for an honest artist tofall. when, however, a customer demands something cheap, he can obtainit in so-called american glass, and it will be cheap enough. there hasbeen also a deplorable tendency among some prominent american glassmakers toward startling theatrical effects. of unchurchly windows,windows hopelessly and utterly unchurchly, the great majority doubtlessare of the american school; nor are they the windows which have costthe least money. novel and indescribable colors, as far removed aspossible from all sober, reverent, devotional feeling, have beenemployed; effects have been sought which actually destroy all the valueof the window as what it was designed by its architect, a window ina sacred edifice. and by the wide heralding of such performances, asif american glass meant simply this sort of thing, american glass hasforfeited that just appreciation which in its essential principles itso richly merits. let the american school remember that a window ina church is and forever must remain just a window, subservient thatis, to the architecture of the church; let it design in the spirit ofworshipful, reverent, dignified, sober devotion; let it compose withtechnical conscientiousness and love its leads and spare no labor;let it choose thoroughly good glass, and glass of predominantly theglorious colors so long honorable, eschewing startling and meretriciouseffects: and there will, to our mind, be no doubt of its being thestained glass of the future.but, to our thinking, one thing cannot safely be done; and that is theplacing of english and american, or munich and american glass side byside in the same building. let it be the one or the other; when youhave chosen which it shall be, adhere to that. to mingle the schoolsin the same edifice will be sure to prove fatal to the best effects ofeach.and before placing any permanent stained glass, again let us say, studythe subject; see all the windows you can; and make haste slowly.[illustration] stained glass windows for grace church, lockport. a report to the vestry of the parish by its rector, january , .after many months of inquiry, reflection, special study, and suchvisits to churches as opportunity afforded, we are at last in aposition to bring together the facts bearing upon this importantproject, and to submit the results for your consideration.grace church,[b] lockport, is an edifice which though not striking orornate, is in point of architectural merit, of conspicuous importancein the community, in probable permanence and enduring interest secondto none in our city. erected more than forty years ago, of stone, itsinterior chastely beautified and enriched at successive periods; itsnave alone over one hundred feet long, forty-six feet wide, fiftyfeet high; its lofty chancel with a window twenty-two feet in height,nearly ten feet in width: it impresses the educated eye on enteringit as beautiful and churchly, characterized by simple grace andreverent dignity, and the exclusion of the tawdry and incongruous. wemay honestly admit some faults. what building, religious or other,is without them? but it is a church which grows upon us the longerwe worship in it; it becomes homelike to us, and yet excites ouradmiration the more as we become better acquainted with it.[b] the design was one of richard upjohn’s.this is the building which is committed to our care. not only thatwe keep it clean and in repair, warmed and lighted, not only thatwe preserve the fabric as a valuable piece of property; but thatcontinuing to labor in the spirit of those who have preceded us, wesecure such further additions to it as will tend to make it complete inits kind.we say, complete in its kind. and it is our sacred duty, therefore,to understand what it is that we already have, as well as to ask whatfurther gifts and further embellishments might add thereto. for toadd, with the best intention and with lavish generosity, but withoutan understanding of the conditions and limitations imposed by theexisting edifice, might easily result in such disastrous incongruityas a future generation, if not ours, would deplore. the land is fullof warning examples, and one is at times appalled to think of the vastsums embodied in worse than waste, from which our better educateddescendants after us will suffer in the years to come. knowledge isbound to grow; travel and study cannot fail to make an understanding ofthese things the common property of intelligent church people as timegoes on. and it is a grave responsibility to be at the head of a parishin which permanent work is undertaken and executed, work on which thefuture is to pronounce judgment. this responsibility, let me add, yourrector for one feels very seriously and deeply.a very common form of architectural enrichment in this day of growingwealth and of increasing commemoration of the departed is that ofstained glass windows. no memorial can be more beautiful than this whenwisely planned and well executed. none can be much more painful orincessantly offensive when inartistic, incongruous, or lacking in thetrue devotional spirit.and as touching our own case, it is reasonably certain that offers willbe made to place such windows in grace church. it would be ungenerousto decline them. moreover, we cannot escape the moral obligation ofdirecting what such memorials shall be, so far as the building itself,its style of architecture, its uses, and its history, shall impose theconditions. it is not a question of dictating to intending donors: forthe vestry to decline to exercise such control would be for us to failof a sacred trust.our church, we may be most thankful to bear in mind, is built in astyle pure and self-consistent, plain as it is. it is early english, ofthe first and simplest of the periods of gothic. to treat it as if itwere of some other style, in any changes or additions we might see fitto make hereafter, would be to do violence to the edifice, to wrong itsintelligent and loving builders in the days of good bishop de lancey,and those who shall inherit it after we are gone. there is meaning andpurpose in it, as it is: in every line of it, in every arch, everydimension, every grouping and distribution of parts.we are not at liberty, therefore, to change the window openings, insize or form, unless indeed we wish to rebuild the church. we may atour taste reconstruct the windows in the houses in which we live, butwe cannot alter the style of these windows without destroying the styleof the architecture. the series of long narrow lancets, no matter howlong or how narrow, are right; and with all their severe simplicity,their beauty of outline and their grace and dignity grow upon one themore they are studied. mediæval builders had a meaning even in puttingsuch windows in pairs; it may seem to us a little fantastic, but asthey made everything symbolical, so in this grouping they symbolizedour lord’s sending out his apostles two and two. apart from such aconsideration, there is a quiet grace in this long succession oflancet pairs which may safely be left to speak for itself.the development of window forms is itself very interesting, and shouldbe understood before an attempt is made to treat any church windowsin particular. mrs. van rensselaer, who has done so much to make theenglish cathedrals known in this country, thus traces the successivesteps from style to style: “fancy first a plain tall window with around-arched head; then the round exchanged for a pointed head; thentwo, or three, or five perhaps, of these pointed windows set closetogether; and then a projecting moulding in the shape of an arch drawnaround them, including them all and thus including, of necessity, aplain piece of wall above their heads. then fancy this piece of wallpierced with a few small openings, and we have a group of connectedlights in which, as a plant in its embryo, lies the promise of allafter-development....“the small lights in the upper field enlarge and multiply until theyform a connected pattern which fills its whole area, and the jambs ofthe main lights diminish into narrow strips or very slender columns.the great arch, which in the first place did but encircle the windows,thus becomes itself the window――the ‘plate-traceried’ window which wasrichly developed in early french gothic, but less richly in english,owing to the persistent local love for mere groups of lancets. thenall the stone-work shrinks still farther――the columnar character ofthe uprights is lost, and the flat surfaces between the upper openingschange into mouldings of complex section. thus the original talllights and upper piercings surrender their last claim to independence;the uprights are no longer jambs or bits of wall but mullions, thearch-head is filled with genuine traceries, and all the elements of thedesign are vitally fused together within the sweep of the great windowto form its multiple yet organic beauty.”the art of making stained glass windows went hand in hand with thisdevelopment of architectural forms through the eleventh, twelfth,thirteenth and succeeding centuries. it has indeed been calledthe “principal branch of mediæval art;” but was always treated asabsolutely subservient to the particular architecture itself. a mosteminent authority denies that the art of glass-staining has ever beenlost. glass itself was used by christians in their churches from theearliest church-building times; the distinct art of painting on glassemerges, one might say, with the springing up of pointed architecture,though the beginnings show themselves in norman architecture in theeleventh century. four centuries the two arts flourished side byside; with the decadence of the greater came also the decline of thesubsidiary; a poorer taste in building was naturally accompaniedby a poorer taste in glass. with the revival of interest in thoselong-neglected periods of noble achievement, the oxford movement ofchurch restoration giving men the religious guiding principles for anintelligent appreciation of the forms of mediæval art, church buildingand glass staining were brought back again, the one with the other. andwhether such restoration can leave us satisfied with the mere recoveryof the riches of by-gone ages, or must mean also, as i believe, thedevelopment of what the present can contribute in a reverent but notslavish spirit――certain it is that the first step is to understand thepast, to find out what was done in the great formative and classicperiods, why it was done as it was and not otherwise, in a word, tomaster the models before we proceed on our own course; and, as i saidbefore, to remember to which period and style our own edifice belongs.it was my good fortune when recently in the city of philadelphia, toobtain access to a rare work over which i spent some very delightfulhours. its author was a william warrington, himself a designer andproducer of windows, and a reverent student of ancient examples, whopublished his great folio in london, in . from him i learned manythings about the beginnings and progress of the art. great were thedifficulties of the eleventh century pioneers. they had to contendwith defective methods of manufacture; not understanding glass-blowingthey fused their glass in pots and crucibles, and cast it to aboutthe required shape, in pieces not more than four or five inches indiameter. cutting with the diamond was not known till the sixteenthcentury. they designed and made and erected their own work. whengreat orders were to be executed, artists were brought together fromthe different countries, and by a sort of “free-masonry” they workedtogether in perfect agreement as to styles, rules, and principles.in the course of time, different countries produced slightly differingschools.as in heraldry, the colors of the glass were intended for colors ofprecious stones; the representations of figures and objects were notmeant to be pictures, but being also strictly symbolical, the drawingwas conventional, with no intention to reproduce nature in color, orform, or position and perspective. the figures which excite ridiculeon the part of one who is without the clue, justify themselves by thisprinciple; nor is it quite true to say the men of that time did notknow how to draw――their ability in this respect was not that of artiststo-day, but if their object had been to produce a figure or a scene forthe sole purpose of a picture, they might certainly and would certainlyhave given us something very different from what they did. while thesmall separate pieces are often very minutely pencilled, all such workbeing afterward burned in――there is no “shadowing,” as in a picture,supposing the light to fall from a certain direction; but a kind of“relief” shading, making the view suitable to any aspect. in a word,the drawing is the same as in mss., tapestries and heraldic designs.ruby and sapphire were the ground colors. and in all the work theprimitive colors were adhered to.in york minister there is to be found the largest and finest specimenof thirteenth century glass in england in a group of lancets knownas the “five sisters.” the lancets are each six feet wide and fiftyfeet high, and each divided into thirteen compartments or squaresof different patterns. their designs being largely of an ornamentalcharacter, they escaped destruction by the puritans.it is a curious fact that english stained glass at no time had largefigures. in the thirteenth century continental art in this respectdiverged from ancient and english, under italian influence.in the cathedral of bourges there are one hundred and eighty-threestained glass windows, executed from the thirteenth century downwards.the early lancets have figures occupying the larger part of the window,sometimes fifteen or twenty feet high; over each figure a sort ofcanopy or tabernacle disproportionately small, and under it a kind ofpedestal or base about a foot high. around the margin is the finestwork in the windows, in a broad band of mosaic.cologne cathedral has four lancets each eleven times its width inheight, filled with early glass of this period; the figures in thewindows are in height one-third the height of the lancet, with a canopyabove them.the developments of the centuries following are of less interest to ourpresent purpose. suffice it to say that even in the rich decoratedstyle of architecture the treatment of individual windows was not whatwe might term ambitious: the effect was secured by not attemptingtoo much in a single window, but by producing a rich harmony withsubordination of each to the whole. in the perpendicular style whichfollowed, in the fifteenth century, while there was a very abundantproduction of glass, its quality was inferior, and much white glass wasused. figures with canopies were used when the single openings wereone foot wide and upward; panels, when they were considerably larger;and to fill the extreme length, story upon story. and there begins toappear a tendency to conform the glass less to the architecture itself.from the sixteenth century on there is marked decay. the attempts totreat glass like canvas prove an entire failure. a voluptuous andsensual school of painting came in, debasing a religious art, whichthus became secularized, and almost disappeared. the destruction offine ancient examples in the puritan revolution left england very poor,and the little that remained came to be less and less appreciated.curiously enough, large importations of glass consequent on the frenchrevolution with its destruction of churches, put into the hands ofenglish churchmen what the religious revival of the church soontaught them to appreciate once more, and so it is that to-day englandis enriching her cathedrals and churches with restorations and newwindows; and from her the impulse has naturally come to our own landalso. but the production of stained glass is in america of very recentdate.from facts like the foregoing we may conclude that the subject is oneof importance and involving so much that it is well that we shouldproceed cautiously in the placing of stained glass in grace church.but shall we encourage such a movement at all?it seems to me that this is the moment supremely opportune for us toinaugurate a scheme of window treatment such as shall glorify our houseof god more and more till it reaches completion. how long it may taketo reach completion is in a sense immaterial. that we should begin now,and make every step a right one, is the great matter.the practical question is, shall we choose to admit one or a fewstriking windows into this edifice, windows which may have no relationto each other, produced possibly by methods or on principles entirelyat variance, in color-schemes discordant, in scale of drawing entirelydissimilar and unequal: or shall we guide intending donors to suchgifts as shall be a satisfaction and a delight forever, beautifuleach in itself, but more beautiful still when assembled? this i takeit is the question. for i believe windows will be placed, whether weencourage it or not, within a decade, possibly much sooner. and wheni put the question thus, it appears to me there is but one answerpossible.let us then get down to the practical details in the matter. leavingthe great chancel window entirely out of consideration, we have fivepairs of lancets of equal size on either side of the nave, and a sixth,smaller pair over the doors in continuation of the series up to thechancel. we have further, the magnificent group of three lancets at thefoot of the nave, with a fourth lancet a little smaller, and still muchlarger than those in the pairs already referred to.here is a considerable number of windows――twenty-nine when we countin the chancel window; what an opportunity for discord and artisticanarchy! let us say, rather, what a remarkable and rare opportunity forthe production of a rich and hallowed splendor, fitted not only toexpress the consecration of man’s gifts to god, but to instruct theminds and quicken the devotions of generations to come.the objection which most readily offers itself when stained glass isproposed for grace church is that the twenty lancets at the sides areso extremely narrow and so very high that nothing can be done withthem. if by ‘doing something’ is meant putting in scenes with severalor many figures, it is most true. the breadth of wall between the twowindows constituting the pair is so large that the scene could not becarried from the one to the other. but surely that does not exhaust thepossibilities. the openings are wide enough to permit the treatment ofsingle figures in full life-size if desired; figures with canopies,borders, and panels at the base, as in the best periods of ancientglass. the breadth of these openings is twenty-one inches; six inchesmore than that of the small pair erected all saints, , at the sideof the pulpit, in which the figures are certainly of dignified stature,and by no means poor in back ground and accessories. if such resultsare possible in a space fifteen inches wide and six feet high; how muchmore in a space twenty-one inches wide and thirteen feet high.single figures, therefore, are demanded by the conditions which governus, for the side lancets; unless we rest content with geometrical,or flower windows, or windows bearing emblems, more or less ornatelybordered. i venture to say that at this stage of our history, whenwe are not pressed to fill our window-openings with whatever may beobtainable, we desire the best that can be had. this best, for the sidelancets is,――single figures, with canopy, border and base panel.mr. f. s. lamb of new york, who designed the beautiful work erecteda year ago, has prepared and sent me two pairs of colored sketches,suggesting a noble and beautiful form which in the execution would, ofcourse, far surpass what appears in the drawings. they are submittedfor your careful study, and may be seen at any time in my library.what then shall the figures be? shall they be chosen at random?artistically speaking, this might not be so disastrous, provided thesame artist drew all the designs and controlled the execution, so thatthe scale of drawing and the scheme of color were kept in accord. andthat is a great deal more than can be said of some of the principalchurches in our greatest cities, where immense sums have been spent onthese works. no; there is something better still, open to us. it is aserial treatment, with unity, and progress: so that the whole, whencomplete, shall tell one great story, each part a chapter therein;the whole impress one truth, each part contributing somewhat to thecumulative force of the great lesson.and, not to detain you with all the processes of thought and longreflection by which at last we reach our conclusion――the figures wesuggest are those which are conspicuous and representative in theold and new testaments. our divine lord himself should be, as he is,exalted in the great window over the altar. beginning from the angleof the chancel arch to pass around the church, we come first to thepair of small windows next to the organ, from which now the light isexcluded by the parish building. they may be taken as in a sense goingwith the organ, and scarcely a part of the general scheme. let thembe treated, at some time, in mosaic, with singing angels,[c] thuscorresponding to the angels directly opposite in the correspondingsmall windows. then we pass to the first pair of lancets of uniformsize, melchizedek and abraham: the latter the great father of thefaithful, the head of the covenant people; the former even superiorto him, a priest forever, without beginning or end of days, type ofour lord’s own highpriesthood. melchizedek appears before abraham,bearing bread and wine, foreshadowing of the holy eucharist. what moresuitable, as we look up to the altar and see above it the figure of ourblessed lord, than to turn to the head of the nave, and find here, atthe dawn of religious history, standing out as type of the christ inwhom the course of the ages shall culminate, this king of salem at thevery beginning?[c] recently placed.we pass on. the next pair will be moses and samuel: both conspicuousas appointed of god to lead, to rule, to judge the people whom god hadchosen; founders of israel as a nation. surely these, if any, we mustcommemorate as among the greatest in the covenant history.this brings us to the third or middle pair. woman, too, bears herconspicuous part in the spiritual history of mankind. deborah[d] judgedisrael for forty years in a period of disorder and confusion, and ledthe way to victory: ruth,[d] a very different type, beautiful andgentle, became one of that line of whom david, and david’s greater son,were born. other women might have been chosen, as well as other men;but on the whole, none more typical, none better fitted to instruct andto impress.[d] now in place.the fourth pair continues the narrative. david and elijah, each sostriking in his way, bring back the kingdom in its glory and thekingdom in its disaster; religion sweetly ministrant with music, andreligion sternly denouncing national sin; the royal harp, and theprophetic mantle.and finally, the fifth pair on this side, isaiah and malachi: thegreatest of all the prophets, called the evangelist of the oldtestament; and the last of seers, who most clearly foretold bothmessiah and forerunner.thus we arrive at one of the entrances, and turning the corner, westand before the first of the windows at the lower end. it is largeenough to admit more than one figure. it continues the story frommalachi, to him who went before the face of the lord: it presents to usst. john the baptist,[e] baptizing at jordan; and close by it standsthe font with its summons, as of old, to the washing away of sins.[e] to be erected in the near future.a splendid opportunity is presented by the great group next in order,the three associated windows piercing the end wall of the nave.majestic in their simple dignity of outline, what will they not bewhen filled with stained glass as they should be? here is space,indeed――ample room for that scene treatment of which the side-wallwindows are incapable.let the middle one, which is much the largest, be the nativity;[f]that on the right side (next to st. john baptist) the presentation inthe temple,[f] with simeon’s nunc dimittis; that on the left side, theepiphany,[f] with the gifts of the magi. thus will this entire end-wallset forth the incarnation, up to which the old testament has led us,and out of which proceeds the new, and all the history of the christianchurch.[f] now in place.turning again, and passing on, back once more toward the chancel,the first and second pairs of lancets on the cottage street side aredevoted to the four evangelists, sts. matthew, mark, luke and john. noexplanation is needed of the propriety of putting these figures here.not only as the biographers of the lord jesus christ, but as chieffounders of that church which is builded upon historic facts――men ofdeeds as well as writers――we commemorate them.the middle pair is again given to two great women of the new testament,mothers both and as mothers supremely great: st. elizabeth[g] and st.mary.[g] of the son of the first one it was said, among those born ofwomen there hath not appeared a greater than john. to the other theangel’s word was, hail, thou that are highly favored: the lord is withthee; and blessed art thou among women. no two characters can lay moreclaim to our gratitude and reverence than these two women to whom anallwise god entrusted the tender formative years of the forerunner andof the messiah.there is indeed a glorious company of apostles, and a noble army ofmartyrs, whom one would gladly set forth, two and two, in goodlysuccession. two pairs must suffice us: first st. andrew[g] and st.stephen;[g] next st. peter[g] and st. paul.[g] we begin with st.andrew, for he readily obeyed the calling of christ and followed himwithout delay, bringing his brother also: type of self-devotion andpersonal service, forever. st. stephen, set apart for the church’scharitable work, filled with the holy ghost and a mighty preacher,――hewas the first deacon, and became the first martyr. st. peter and st.paul bring us to a climax in the church’s realization of the greatcommission; prince apostles, the former first led to the gentiles butafterward distinctly charged with the gospel to the circumcision; thelatter sent out to the uncircumcision, truest champion of a catholicfaith and uncompromising leader of a catholic church. he brings us, aswe pass the two angel figures over the door, up to the pulpit,――whofitter than he to be set always before the preacher?――and thence againwe see before us the altar and the figure of our blessed lord fromwhich we started on our circuit;[g] now in place. “christ is the end, for christ was the beginning: christ the beginning, and the end is christ.”this is the scheme which is hereby recommended to your attentiveconsideration, your criticism, and if worthy, your adoption. whenadopted, each opening will be available only for the subject assignedto it, treated in the best style, under the direction and approvalof the vestry. windows may be erected in any order, provided theseconditions are complied with; though it is highly desirable that notless than a pair――where there are pairs――should be placed at a time.it is immaterial how many persons join in donating a window. the useof the windows for memorials is very beautiful and very desirable; butthere is no restriction to such use, by anything in the scheme.and in closing let it be added, that if――as undoubtedly they will――thevestry and parish shall feel sincerely thankful to those whoparticipate in this pious work, it is not there that the gratitudeshould chiefly lie. it is an unspeakable privilege to be permittedto place a memorial like this in the house of god, bringing ever newcomfort and joy to hearts bereaved, and satisfaction to the donors;yes, if there is need to say it, it is an honor to be permitted to doit. moreover, in the nature of the case, it is a privilege very limitedas to the number of those who can be so favored; and with every windowthat is taken, the number remaining available becomes rapidly less. * * * * *the above report with its recommendations was adopted, entire, byunanimous vote of the vestry at the regular monthly meeting, january ,.

churches will posterity thank us a revival of religious art we welcome with profound gratitude but whenfor the moment it threatens to take the form of an epidemic of stainedglass our joy may be turned

advantage too of a vulgarspirit of rivalry and the end thereof must be painful to are often given a free hand in god s house on the groundthat thus several hundred or several thousand dollars will be

place to tell briefly and simply whatstained glass windows in a church ought to be and what stained glassitself glass windows are still after all windows and windows areessential component parts of a building if in a church the axiomapplies the more inevitably a church is a building presumed to conformrigidly to a certain type and therefore the idea which the whole isto exhibit and impress must not for a moment be hidden or dissipated byany component dwelling houses may be often built in a haphazard way with aview simply to utility regardless of style laying no claim toarchitectural art but to build a church so is an offense an offenseto art and we believe an offense to religion also a church buildingis presumed and expected to have a certain character technicallycalled style dignifying and elevating god s house above our commonhouses even though it be small and plain and not costly smalland plain it may be and not costly but it must not be tawdry orincongruous or a window is as we have said a component part of the a church well conceived the window is inevitable just as it is to make it larger or smaller to close one up where now there is oneor to make one where there is none is just so far to do violence tothe building if such a change does not violate the integrity of thebuilding as a whole the fact simply goes to show that the building hadno plan worthy of is therefore always to be preserved for such and just so much as the architect gave us the use of awindow barring for the moment the unscientific one of ventilation isto give light while still affording shelter and this isalso to serve artistically as a kind of balance to the dark space ofthe solid wall hence this is to art sacred and must bepermitted to the end to assert itself as just what it is and such as itis so much rightly apportioned and correctly proportioned this has been first filled with a plain glass whichis then to give way to stained glass the new treatment must say justas obviously only more beautifully what the old said it must stillbe a in light though now the light is inits architectural value it must be just what it was before assertingthe shape and the design of the structural window plainly other words the true stained glass a church buildingworthy of that not now to give the beholder the impressionthat he is looking out through an opening and seeing of somethingbeyond so much as the size of the opening will permit in a word thespectacular impression of looking into some beautiful worldthrough a hole in the wall the beholder must be conscious still oflooking at the wall itself the translucent part of it which confineshim within the edifice as much as the stone or the brick nor yet isthe true stained glass window merely a colored glass picture coveringso much wall area the outline form is to be so obvious and thetreatment so that the architectural idea may never for amoment be in danger of submersion under some other as is true in general of decorative art as contrasted withpictorial art the true church window is to be designed withoutperspective without shadow without attempt at realistic effect it isto be conventional symbolical with that intent it may utilize as itwill forms colors attitudes postures accessories fearless of thecriticism that this saint or that scene never in the world looked no intelligent person standing before decorative painting wouldfor a moment think of demanding a representation of the actual that frankly was not its the stained glass church window will further fulfill its particularend if all round the figure or group or whatever be the subject matterof the composition there runs a clear line or border of differentlycolored glass making a clear demarcation from the stone wall drawingagain as it were the architect s line of his window of which is but to say that windows were made for the sake of thebuilding and so must remain not that a building was made for thesake of windows the sake of furnishing so much space for somany square yards of somebody s beautiful glass which ought to though to many persons it is not regarding it now the further question naturally occurs as to thetreatment of the several windows of one particular church for eachindividual window might be in itself correct according to the aboveprinciples and yet the total effect sadly lacking in unity and is first of all the consideration of style a difficult matterto define yet not after all so difficult to determine what oughtcertainly not to determine it is the chance ability of some wealthydonor or donors to pay for the costliest work that could be produced nor on the other hand the limited ability of others who could giveonly something inexpensive the style of the building and its generalcharacter must determine the degree of splendor and ornateness whichwill be right for each and all the windows if there be wealth to dostill more then exercise sober if there be availablemeans only to do part of what the building demands better do just somuch as can be rightly and adequately done though the scheme shouldwait many years for its entire completion in building a new church let this also be thought of in there is the question of a single scheme of subjects for all thewindows so that all when completed shall tell chapter by chapter one great story or part by part one great truth say the christianfaith or the redemption of man or the sacramental economy of grace or the history of religion or the mission of the church in theworld thus again as in old time will the church windows instructthe people and the sum total of that instruction will be a unity with harmony and interrelation of parts of the utmost value to soundchristian thinking and feeling and to symmetry of christian it is just this which our modern religion so much lacks the sadresult of sectarian thinking and teaching where each hath a doctrine a truth and few the whole doctrine and the wholeness of let us realize is not what the church should foster though individuality in its rightful place be precious and application here is not fanciful sadly absurd examples there are where ecclesiastical art has been pressed into service by sectarianminds not among the sects alone to teach some one portion or fragmentof truth through the eye every time the eye gazed upon the interior ofthe house of worship and fell upon the favorite symbol or not this alone individualism is rampant in our day in theform of utterly arbitrary choice of subjects as well as of theirmode of treatment in point of material color scale of drawing a babel of confusion is the result and that insome of our foremost churches which have become thereby rather picturegalleries or museums adapted to the study of all schools and alltastes than restful devotional solemnizing and uplifting temples forthe worship of almighty god a low motive ruled and how can one helpfeeling it as one looks upon the performance the wealthy donor or the ambitious artist forgetting whose this house was demanded worship for himself verily they have their therefore let those who have such things in charge study first of allwhat a church should be and then what their particular church suchas they have received it in trust is it will often be found that abuilding very little esteemed has something to say for itself andis worthy of respect as originally conceived in its own structuralcharacter as designed by its architect and if not and if it mustbe borne with then all the more reason in planning to do anythingfurther in it or upon it to abhor that which is evil and cleave tothat which is and after such careful study determine before the first enthusiasthas an opportunity to put into some one window chosen at random a mostsuperb production of the much advertised glass man determine inadvance what should be your total result when every window shall havebeen filled with stained glass what story the whole shall tell howbest its parts may be distributed what each part shall be in whatstyle what design what scale of drawing scheme of when this has been determined in the fear of god in sobernessof judgment in conscientious fidelity to a sacred trust with awillingness to be judged by a wiser posterity let such a planbe adhered to as a law of the medes and persians which altereth sacrifice one window to the seductions of some alien grandeur isto sacrifice the whole principle at stake the plain glass patientlyawaiting its time to give way to the right thing is more eloquentof a truly reverent and truly artistic intention than a medley ofincongruous splendors now what is stained glass this simple question it is of theutmost importance to answer because a little familiarity with thematerials and the methods of workmanship will itself serve as a guideto the choice of good windows and to the avoidance of glass then is simply glass which has been colored in the pot glass which has its color within itself while painted termsometimes used as synonymous with stained properly glasswhich has had the color painted upon its surface and has then beenfired so that the colored or enameled surface has been vitrified somestained glass is of so deep a color for a thincoating of it blown over the surface of a white that is colorless glass is sufficient to produce the desired color effect if the entirethickness of the pane were of the colored glass the effect would bemuch too dark such glass is nevertheless true stained glass and iscalled in the early period of the art beginning in the eleventh century andrunning parallel with the development of pointed commonly calledgothic architecture only true stained glass was used the use ofenamel paints applied to the surface to produce a different colormarks also the beginning of the decadence of the art for the glory oftrue glass is in its quality its color being within itselfand all absolutely translucent while a painted glass will always benecessarily dull in comparison the temptation to paint color upon thesurface of glass is readily understood it was an easier method itpromised wider scope greater variety in a word the opportunity tomake pictures somewhat as the painter may upon canvas but glass isnot canvas and church windows are not to be pictures retribution hasovertaken this work and the latest and most ambitious more speedilythan all the glass has not stood the test of time becoming muddy and perishing while the true ancient stained glass isstill the joy and wonder of all who gaze upon as we have said the glory of true stained glass is in its rich color its reds which the makers called ruby its blueswhich they called sapphire with its emerald greens its gold andits pearl never entered the field to compete with the achievementsof the painter s brush to compare the delight they afford the beholderwith that derived from a painting would be in a sense as impossible asa comparison between the fragrance of a flower and the cadence of early makers of stained glass windows contended with great tomoderns they would be intolerable limitations they were almostabsolutely restricted to the primary colors they had not at first theart of blowing glass but cast their pieces in small panes of at mostfour or five inches in diameter the use of the diamond in cuttingwas not known till the sixteenth century hence their work was simplymosaic for variety they depended upon an arrangement of geometricalpatterns or patterns of familiar architectural form and of commonecclesiastical symbols to construct these they leaded together theirpieces and bits of glass elaborating their treatment as time went on but always in the main upon the same they began to portray in panels on their windows the forms ofour lord of his apostles of saints and angels sometimes in crudesettings of scenes or incidents from holy scripture or church legend their color principle was still the same and it was still the samein the elaboration of the merely ornamental borders with forms ofleaf or flower or fruit or of sacred emblems and inscriptions thebrown pigment with which they produced faces and features hands feet outlines and ornamentations was not a color nor intended fora color but simply a means of definition or delineation when thiswas too minute to be carried out with leads and the stained glassit was still which addressed the eye and compelled attention andadmiration no more than in heraldry did the forms and emblems pretendto be pictures of the actual realistic representations of men or ofscenes or incidents the makers of early stained glass were in oneword simply makers of ornamental windows of rich color and have said that their pieces of glass were small this is but to saythat their windows were a network of leads for there is but one way tohold together such pieces of glass in a window and that is by leads are not a misfortune a square yard of simple red stainedglass is artistically more beautiful if composed of a hundred piecesleaded together than if it were in a single sheet the differencesin texture themselves produce a better result and the black leads scarcely discernible individually contribute an additional elementof pleasure and in arranging pieces of different color side by side intelligent leading design was itself the artist s drawing andeffected results altogether admirable so far was this art of leadingcarried in france for instance that windows mainly of white glasswere produced of rare beauty by simple virtue of their this was changed by the men who in a later age ground up theirenamel pigments glazed windows in large panes and daubed upon themtheir muddy colors with a sublime contempt for the crude laboriousmosaic work of their predecessors would they have a representationof the earth for their figure to stand upon it must be carpetedwith grass with green grass and they can paint green grass upon acolorless surface red flowers also upon the same with red paint ifsuch were desired the renaissance was coming gothic was barbarousanyway antiquated crudities must give place to refined work worthyof the new enlightenment paint a picture on canvas then paint thatpicture on your glass it can be done certainly if you will not allowyourself to be bothered with the nuisance of leads but just get anample pane of glass unobstructed and go at it with your brush andpaints this miserable travesty did not long hold sway it was scarcelypermitted to go its own theoretical length there came great politicalchanges great religious changes and for a long time few churchesmore were built nor even those standing kept in repair the courseof ecclesiastical architecture suffered an interruption for severalcenturies of which ralph adams cram has told us feelingly in hisrecent writings on that subject within the memory of men now living there has also come thebeginning of a true revival the awakening of the catholic spiritin the anglican communion has been accompanied by an eager desire torecover lost treasures and to restore sound traditions to their naturally all this has shown itself in the cultivation of stainedglass also as we have said what is needed above all else isknowledge to guide us to what is really good and sooner is any want of the public made evident than enterprisingtrade springs up to supply that want if you want colored churchwindows you can have them at a trifle per square yard bypurchasing a beautifully printed paper of genuine ecclesiasticaldesign and pasting it upon your present windows from this mostabysmal horror of vulgarity you may pass through various successivegradations of stained glass all supplied by trade if youpass on to the costliest you are not thereby sure to obtain what isnot horrible and vulgar when regarded from the point of view of truestained glass of architectural art and of are at this moment three rather diverse schools of stainedglass most in evidence before those who seek and are willing to payfor honest art work the english the german and the american theircomparative merits are nowhere to our knowledge presented in a fairminded way the makers of each claim superior excellence for theirown of course if indeed they ever intimate to the public that thereis any other kind at all it should be said however that there isgreat merit in the best examples of each school and that none of theseschools can fairly be judged by the inferior stuff which is put outunder its name for each of them is defamed by such english school naturally had and still has great prestige amongchurchmen taking it at its best as for instance in the work ofmr henry holiday it is simple and vigorous in drawing varied andharmonious in color churchly in spirit while free from english artist believes in stained glass glass which has its colorwithin itself and good glass the best he can obtain his glass isflat that is of even surface and equal thickness he believes inpainting upon this glass and upon one may say every piece and bitof it but he does not paint a color upon it he simply shades it draws folds of drapery patterns of fabrics details of ornamentations always however aiming to leave it however much so painted withthe color of the glass gleaming and glittering that is he does notdaub over the surface but puts on mere lines and picks out lights so that his painted piece of green glass let us say is still greenglass only with design upon it or texture or light and shade hefeels that only in this way has he done all which as an artist he isconscientiously bound to do and he accounts a piece of mere stainedglass which has not felt the brush at all which has not had the touchof the conscious art of the maker a poor thing in a sort crude the hands of a there have been great masters in theenglish results of this method have been very fine buteven so the fact remains that every line and every particle of evenneutral pigment upon the surface of glass obscures so much light whichis to say it detracts so much from its brilliancy and splendor thefact is undeniable that the total effect of some great window of thisschool will be charming but withal just a little dull the richnesswhich gleams and glitters from it is yet half hidden as by somefluttering veil before it such work at its best is exquisite it isdevotional it is soothing but hardly gives one a thrill of the hands of a master it is a fit medium for strong individualityof a good kind as witness windows executed at the worksof william morris in the hands of the common multitude of englishmakers it degenerates into a wearisome conventional repetition ofstiff figures draped in the same damask stuffs with the same woodenlittle flowers growing up around their feet the whole surrounded bythe same easily managed conventional the german glass commonly called munich glass it is sufficient forour purpose to say that it is in principle the same as the relies much upon the brush it is more in the mediæval spiritthan the english its feeling is that of a simply traditional not amodern devoutness its inspiration is italian its colors are morepredominatingly the old primary colors its decorative features arestrictly conventional and applied in a mechanical spirit in warmth in splendor of color german windows at their best are superior to glass is not simply glass made in america the term denotes anew method which yet is in the main a restoration of the very oldestmethod reinforced on its own lines by modern resources john lafarge is its distinguished glass is true stained glass but it is not glass of evensurface and of equal thickness a by its inequality of thicknessthe american artist effects what the english artist accomplishes bybrushing dark lines upon his even glass or he leads strips and piecesof glass on the back of his window to intensify and deepen his color as in folds of drapery and the like he paints nothing except faces hands and feet all the rest he binds himself to obtain by the mosaicmethod he can not obtain by the mosaic method everything that theenglish artist obtains by the brush but he feels that he obtains allwhich in a window is necessary and by patient thoroughly artisticwork he obtains what upon study proves marvelous and he has all hisglass free to exhibit the full glory of glass his very necessitiescompel him to compose in the true way that is by lead lines he isback upon first principles in this respect the lead lines mark thestructural lines of his drawing but he has still to contend with thenecessity of painting his flesh parts and of overcoming the breakbetween their flatness between the dull hardness of painted faces hands and feet and the splendid strength of all the restof his window the best he can do is to make this transition as littleabrupt as possible a the earliest glass was not glass of even surface and equalthickness therein lies one of its to say the american school has its dangers the ease withwhich an ignorant eye may be imposed upon by great pieces of foldedglass instead of conscientiously selected and leaded strips and pieces is a snare into which it is not necessary for an honest artist tofall when however a customer demands something cheap he can obtainit in american glass and it will be cheap enough there hasbeen also a deplorable tendency among some prominent american glassmakers toward startling theatrical effects of unchurchly windows windows hopelessly and utterly unchurchly the great majority doubtlessare of the american school nor are they the windows which have costthe least money novel and indescribable colors as far removed aspossible from all sober reverent devotional feeling have beenemployed effects have been sought which actually destroy all the valueof the window as what it was designed by its architect a window ina sacred edifice and by the wide heralding of such performances asif american glass meant simply this sort of thing american glass hasforfeited that just appreciation which in its essential principles itso richly merits let the american school remember that a window ina church is and forever must remain just a window subservient thatis to the architecture of the church let it design in the spirit ofworshipful reverent dignified sober devotion let it compose withtechnical conscientiousness and love its leads and spare no labor let it choose thoroughly good glass and glass of predominantly theglorious colors so long honorable eschewing startling and meretriciouseffects and there will to our mind be no doubt of its being thestained glass of the to our thinking one thing can not safely be done and that is theplacing of english and american or munich and american glass side byside in the same building let it be the one or the other when youhave chosen which it shall be adhere to that to mingle the schoolsin the same edifice will be sure to prove fatal to the best effects before placing any permanent stained glass again let us say studythe subject see all the windows you can and make haste slowly illustration stained glass windows for grace church lockport a report to the vestry of the parish by its rector january many months of inquiry reflection special study and suchvisits to churches as opportunity afforded we are at last in aposition to bring together the facts bearing upon this importantproject and to submit the results for your church b lockport is an edifice which though not striking orornate is in point of architectural merit of conspicuous importancein the community in probable permanence and enduring interest secondto none in our city erected more than forty years ago of stone itsinterior chastely beautified and enriched at successive periods itsnave alone over one hundred feet long feet wide fiftyfeet high its lofty chancel with a window feet in height nearly ten feet in width it impresses the educated eye on enteringit as beautiful and churchly characterized by simple grace andreverent dignity and the exclusion of the tawdry and incongruous wemay honestly admit some faults what building religious or other is without them but it is a church which grows upon us the longerwe worship in it it becomes homelike to us and yet excites ouradmiration the more as we become better acquainted with it b the design was one of richard upjohn is the building which is committed to our care not only thatwe keep it clean and in repair warmed and lighted not only thatwe preserve the fabric as a valuable piece of property but thatcontinuing to labor in the spirit of those who have preceded us wesecure such further additions to it as will tend to make it complete inits say complete in its kind and it is our sacred duty therefore to understand what it is that we already have as well as to ask whatfurther gifts and further embellishments might add thereto for toadd with the best intention and with lavish generosity but withoutan understanding of the conditions and limitations imposed by theexisting edifice might easily result in such disastrous incongruityas a future generation if not ours would deplore the land is fullof warning examples and one is at times appalled to think of the vastsums embodied in worse than waste from which our better educateddescendants after us will suffer in the years to come knowledge isbound to grow travel and study can not fail to make an understanding ofthese things the common property of intelligent church people as timegoes on and it is a grave responsibility to be at the head of a parishin which permanent work is undertaken and executed work on which thefuture is to pronounce judgment this responsibility let me add yourrector for one feels very seriously and very common form of architectural enrichment in this day of growingwealth and of increasing commemoration of the departed is that ofstained glass windows no memorial can be more beautiful than this whenwisely planned and well executed none can be much more painful orincessantly offensive when inartistic incongruous or lacking in thetrue devotional as touching our own case it is reasonably certain that offers willbe made to place such windows in grace church it would be ungenerousto decline them moreover we can not escape the moral obligation ofdirecting what such memorials shall be so far as the building itself its style of architecture its uses and its history shall impose theconditions it is not a question of dictating to intending donors forthe vestry to decline to exercise such control would be for us to failof a sacred church we may be most thankful to bear in mind is built in astyle pure and plain as it is it is early english ofthe first and simplest of the periods of gothic to treat it as if itwere of some other style in any changes or additions we might see fitto make hereafter would be to do violence to the edifice to wrong itsintelligent and loving builders in the days of good bishop de lancey and those who shall inherit it after we are gone there is meaning andpurpose in it as it is in every line of it in every arch everydimension every grouping and distribution of are not at liberty therefore to change the window openings insize or form unless indeed we wish to rebuild the church we may atour taste reconstruct the windows in the houses in which we live butwe can not alter the style of these windows without destroying the styleof the architecture the series of long narrow lancets no matter howlong or how narrow are right and with all their severe simplicity their beauty of outline and their grace and dignity grow upon one themore they are studied mediæval builders had a meaning even in puttingsuch windows in pairs it may seem to us a little fantastic but asthey made everything symbolical so in this grouping they symbolizedour lord s sending out his apostles two and two apart from such aconsideration there is a quiet grace in this long succession oflancet pairs which may safely be left to speak for development of window forms is itself very interesting and shouldbe understood before an attempt is made to treat any church windowsin particular van rensselaer who has done so much to make theenglish cathedrals known in this country thus traces the successivesteps from style to style fancy first a plain tall window with head then the round exchanged for a pointed head thentwo or three or five perhaps of these pointed windows set closetogether and then a projecting moulding in the shape of an arch drawnaround them including them all and thus including of necessity aplain piece of wall above their heads then fancy this piece of wallpierced with a few small openings and we have a group of connectedlights in which as a plant in its embryo lies the promise of the small lights in the upper field enlarge and multiply until theyform a connected pattern which fills its whole area and the jambs ofthe main lights diminish into narrow strips or very slender great arch which in the first place did but encircle the windows thus becomes itself the window which wasrichly developed in early french gothic but less richly in english owing to the persistent local love for mere groups of lancets thenall the shrinks still columnar character ofthe uprights is lost and the flat surfaces between the upper openingschange into mouldings of complex section thus the original talllights and upper piercings surrender their last claim to independence the uprights are no longer jambs or bits of wall but mullions is filled with genuine traceries and all the elements of thedesign are vitally fused together within the sweep of the great windowto form its multiple yet organic the art of making stained glass windows went hand in hand with thisdevelopment of architectural forms through the eleventh twelfth thirteenth and succeeding centuries it has indeed been calledthe principal branch of mediæval art but was always treated asabsolutely subservient to the particular architecture itself a mosteminent authority denies that the art of has ever beenlost glass itself was used by christians in their churches from theearliest times the distinct art of painting on glassemerges one might say with the springing up of pointed architecture though the beginnings show themselves in norman architecture in theeleventh century four centuries the two arts flourished side byside with the decadence of the greater came also the decline of thesubsidiary a poorer taste in building was naturally accompaniedby a poorer taste in glass with the revival of interest in periods of noble achievement the oxford movement ofchurch restoration giving men the religious guiding principles for anintelligent appreciation of the forms of mediæval art church buildingand glass staining were brought back again the one with the other andwhether such restoration can leave us satisfied with the mere recoveryof the riches of ages or must mean also as i believe thedevelopment of what the present can contribute in a reverent but notslavish it is that the first step is to understand thepast to find out what was done in the great formative and classicperiods why it was done as it was and not otherwise in a word tomaster the models before we proceed on our own course and as i saidbefore to remember to which period and style our own edifice was my good fortune when recently in the city of philadelphia toobtain access to a rare work over which i spent some very delightfulhours its author was a william warrington himself a designer andproducer of windows and a reverent student of ancient examples whopublished his great folio in london in from him i learned manythings about the beginnings and progress of the art great were thedifficulties of the eleventh century pioneers they had to contendwith defective methods of manufacture not understanding fused their glass in pots and crucibles and cast it to aboutthe required shape in pieces not more than four or five inches indiameter cutting with the diamond was not known till the sixteenthcentury they designed and made and erected their own work whengreat orders were to be executed artists were brought together fromthe different countries and by a sort of they workedtogether in perfect agreement as to styles rules and the course of time different countries produced slightly in heraldry the colors of the glass were intended for colors ofprecious stones the representations of figures and objects were notmeant to be pictures but being also strictly symbolical the drawingwas conventional with no intention to reproduce nature in color orform or position and perspective the figures which excite ridiculeon the part of one who is without the clue justify themselves by thisprinciple nor is it quite true to say the men of that time did notknow how to ability in this respect was not that of but if their object had been to produce a figure or a scene forthe sole purpose of a picture they might certainly and would certainlyhave given us something very different from what they did while thesmall separate pieces are often very minutely pencilled all such workbeing afterward burned is no shadowing as in a picture supposing the light to fall from a certain direction but a kind of relief shading making the view suitable to any aspect in a word the drawing is the same as in tapestries and heraldic and sapphire were the ground colors and in all the work theprimitive colors were adhered york minister there is to be found the largest and finest specimenof thirteenth century glass in england in a group of lancets knownas the five the lancets are each six feet wide and fiftyfeet high and each divided into thirteen compartments or squaresof different patterns their designs being largely of an ornamentalcharacter they escaped destruction by the is a curious fact that english stained glass at no time had largefigures in the thirteenth century continental art in this respectdiverged from ancient and english under italian the cathedral of bourges there are one hundred and glass windows executed from the thirteenth century early lancets have figures occupying the larger part of the window sometimes fifteen or twenty feet high over each figure a sort ofcanopy or tabernacle disproportionately small and under it a kind ofpedestal or base about a foot high around the margin is the finestwork in the windows in a broad band of cathedral has four lancets each eleven times its width inheight filled with early glass of this period the figures in thewindows are in height the height of the lancet with a canopyabove developments of the centuries following are of less interest to ourpresent purpose suffice it to say that even in the rich decoratedstyle of architecture the treatment of individual windows was not whatwe might term ambitious the effect was secured by not attemptingtoo much in a single window but by producing a rich harmony withsubordination of each to the whole in the perpendicular style whichfollowed in the fifteenth century while there was a very abundantproduction of glass its quality was inferior and much white glass wasused figures with canopies were used when the single openings wereone foot wide and upward panels when they were considerably larger and to fill the extreme length story upon story and there begins toappear a tendency to conform the glass less to the architecture the sixteenth century on there is marked decay the attempts totreat glass like canvas prove an entire failure a voluptuous andsensual school of painting came in debasing a religious art whichthus became secularized and almost disappeared the destruction offine ancient examples in the puritan revolution left england very poor and the little that remained came to be less and less enough large importations of glass consequent on the frenchrevolution with its destruction of churches put into the hands ofenglish churchmen what the religious revival of the church soontaught them to appreciate once more and so it is that englandis enriching her cathedrals and churches with restorations and newwindows and from her the impulse has naturally come to our own landalso but the production of stained glass is in america of very facts like the foregoing we may conclude that the subject is oneof importance and involving so much that it is well that we shouldproceed cautiously in the placing of stained glass in grace shall we encourage such a movement at all it seems to me that this is the moment supremely opportune for us toinaugurate a scheme of window treatment such as shall glorify our houseof god more and more till it reaches completion how long it may taketo reach completion is in a sense immaterial that we should begin now and make every step a right one is the great practical question is shall we choose to admit one or a fewstriking windows into this edifice windows which may have no relationto each other produced possibly by methods or on principles entirelyat variance in discordant in scale of drawing entirelydissimilar and unequal or shall we guide intending donors to suchgifts as shall be a satisfaction and a delight forever beautifuleach in itself but more beautiful still when assembled this i takeit is the question for i believe windows will be placed whether weencourage it or not within a decade possibly much sooner and wheni put the question thus it appears to me there is but one us then get down to the practical details in the matter leavingthe great chancel window entirely out of consideration we have fivepairs of lancets of equal size on either side of the nave and a sixth smaller pair over the doors in continuation of the series up to thechancel we have further the magnificent group of three lancets at thefoot of the nave with a fourth lancet a little smaller and still muchlarger than those in the pairs already referred is a considerable number of when we countin the chancel window what an opportunity for discord and artisticanarchy let us say rather what a remarkable and rare opportunity forthe production of a rich and hallowed splendor fitted not only toexpress the consecration of man s gifts to god but to instruct theminds and quicken the devotions of generations to objection which most readily offers itself when stained glass isproposed for grace church is that the twenty lancets at the sides areso extremely narrow and so very high that nothing can be done withthem if by doing something is meant putting in scenes with severalor many figures it is most true the breadth of wall between the twowindows constituting the pair is so large that the scene could not becarried from the one to the other but surely that does not exhaust thepossibilities the openings are wide enough to permit the treatment ofsingle figures in full if desired figures with canopies borders and panels at the base as in the best periods of ancientglass the breadth of these openings is inches six inchesmore than that of the small pair erected all saints at the sideof the pulpit in which the figures are certainly of dignified stature and by no means poor in back ground and accessories if such resultsare possible in a space fifteen inches wide and six feet high how muchmore in a space inches wide and thirteen feet figures therefore are demanded by the conditions which governus for the side lancets unless we rest content with geometrical or flower windows or windows bearing emblems more or less ornatelybordered i venture to say that at this stage of our history whenwe are not pressed to fill our with whatever may beobtainable we desire the best that can be had this best for the sidelancets is figures with canopy border and base lamb of new york who designed the beautiful work erecteda year ago has prepared and sent me two pairs of colored sketches suggesting a noble and beautiful form which in the execution would ofcourse far surpass what appears in the drawings they are submittedfor your careful study and may be seen at any time in my then shall the figures be shall they be chosen at random artistically speaking this might not be so disastrous provided thesame artist drew all the designs and controlled the execution so thatthe scale of drawing and the scheme of color were kept in accord andthat is a great deal more than can be said of some of the principalchurches in our greatest cities where immense sums have been spent onthese works no there is something better still open to us it is aserial treatment with unity and progress so that the whole whencomplete shall tell one great story each part a chapter therein the whole impress one truth each part contributing somewhat to thecumulative force of the great not to detain you with all the processes of thought and longreflection by which at last we reach our figures wesuggest are those which are conspicuous and representative in theold and new testaments our divine lord himself should be as he is exalted in the great window over the altar beginning from the angleof the chancel arch to pass around the church we come first to thepair of small windows next to the organ from which now the light isexcluded by the parish building they may be taken as in a sense goingwith the organ and scarcely a part of the general scheme let thembe treated at some time in mosaic with singing angels c thuscorresponding to the angels directly opposite in the correspondingsmall windows then we pass to the first pair of lancets of uniformsize melchizedek and abraham the latter the great father of thefaithful the head of the

immaterial how many persons join in donating a window the useof the windows for memorials is very beautiful and very desirable butthere is no restriction to such use by anything in the in closing let it be added that undoubtedly they and parish shall feel sincerely thankful to those whoparticipate in this pious work it is not there that the gratitudeshould chiefly lie it is an unspeakable privilege to be permittedto place a memorial like this in the house of god bringing ever newcomfort and joy to hearts bereaved and satisfaction to the donors yes if there is need to say it it is an honor to be permitted to doit moreover in the nature of the case it is a privilege very limitedas to the number of those who can be so favored and with every windowthat is taken the number remaining

gracechurch lockport which appeared in january  is now exhaustedas there is a constant demand for it a second is deemed necessary andthe occasion seemed favorable for a little further talk about windowsand glass hence this pamphletthe project of four years ago is no longer an insubstantial dreamsince that time eleven windows and three mosaics have been placed ingrace church in them all the adopted scheme has been followed withresults more and more obviously satisfactoryalthough intending this pamphlet in the first instance simply fora guide to his own people to lead them to a more discriminatingappreciation the author is encouraged to hope by many expressionsfrom the outside that it will even more than the earlier report beof service beyond his parish that it may perhaps stimulate elsewherealso a study of church glass and the erection of true church windows                                                             w f fgrace church rectory lockport all saints’                         stained glass windowsthe subject is certainly one of present interest the advertisements offirms who produce stained glass windows are numerous and conspicuousin our church weeklies glowing accounts of memorials just erected inthis place and that make up a large part of our “diocesan news” tosay nothing of the fact that we are in danger of forgetting what thereal business of the church is――that it is not primarily to build andbeautify edifices but to save men and to establish righteousness inthe earth the uncomfortable question is forced upon us for how muchof this “embellishment” of our churches will posterity thank usa revival of religious art we welcome with profound gratitude but whenfor the moment it threatens to take the form of an epidemic of stainedglass our joy may be turned to apprehension stained glass is simplybecoming fashionable everybody is beginning to want some of it because‘all the other churches are getting some’ commercial enterprisestimulates a wellmeaning zeal taking advantage too of a vulgarspirit of rivalry and the end thereof must be painful to contemplateindividuals are often given a free hand in god’s house on the groundthat thus several hundred or several thousand dollars will be securedfor “enrichment” and so the work goes merrily onand such things can be because there is a lack of knowledge personsmay have the best intention in the world their experience in otherdifferent fields may have been very wide in a general way they mayhave good taste moreover they may possess a long purse and a liberaldisposition perhaps they may think to save themselves from going wrongby putting the whole matter into the hands of strongly advertisedwindowmakers but none of these things will supply the lack of aknowledge of stained glass there is nothing for it but study andeducation the clergy first of all and after them the vestries mustinform themselves on the subject as thoroughly as possible in themeantime let them be slow to lend themselves to anything which theylater or those who come after them might bitterly deplore and behelpless to remedynor is it today so forbidding a task to get this knowledge as itwas but a few years ago then one had to go to the libraries in ourlargest cities and laboriously gather from rare works the historyand principles of this art now there is fortunately at least onesingle volume easily obtainable which may serve as a textbook toall who desire to study the subject mr lewis f day has given us inhis windows a book about stained and painted glass published inlondon  by b t batsford imported by the scribners just thatinformation which is needed no vestry that has the matter of stainedglass memorials before it should permit its rector to be without thisbook he should read mark learn and inwardly digest it but not heonly they also at least the members of any committee responsiblefor such work and intending donors likewise who desire to have acontrolling voice in regard to memorials to be erected this is tooimportant a thing to enter upon recklessly or at the dictation of merefancy                                               meanwhile it may not be out of place to tell briefly and simply whatstained glass windows in a church ought to be and what stained glassitself isstained glass windows are still after all windows and windows areessential component parts of a building if in a church the axiomapplies the more inevitably a church is a building presumed to conformrigidly to a certain type and therefore the idea which the whole isto exhibit and impress must not for a moment be hidden or dissipated byany component partour dwelling houses may be often built in a haphazard way with aview simply to utility regardless of style laying no claim toarchitectural art but to build a church so is an offense an offenseto art and we believe an offense to religion also a church buildingis presumed and expected to have a certain character technicallycalled “style” dignifying and elevating god’s house above our commonhouses even though it be small and plain and not costly smalland plain it may be and not costly but it must not be tawdry orincongruous or meannow a window is as we have said a component part of the buildingin a church well conceived the window is inevitable just as it isto make it larger or smaller to close one up where now there is oneor to make one where there is none is just so far to do violence tothe building if such a change does not violate the integrity of thebuilding as a whole the fact simply goes to show that the building hadno plan worthy of honorthe windowspace is therefore always to be preserved for windowuse――just such and just so much as the architect gave us the use of awindow barring for the moment the unscientific one of ventilation isto give light while still affording shelter and this lightspace isalso to serve artistically as a kind of balance to the dark space ofthe solid wall hence this lightspace is to art sacred and must bepermitted to the end to assert itself as just what it is and such as itis so much rightly apportioned and correctly proportioned translucentwallspacewhen this windowspace has been first filled with a plain glass whichis then to give way to stained glass the new treatment must say justas obviously only more beautifully what the old said it must stillbe a window――letting in light though now the light is colored――and inits architectural value it must be just what it was before assertingthe shape and the design of the structural window plainly andfaithfullyin other words the true stained glass window――in a church buildingworthy of that name――is not now to give the beholder the impressionthat he is looking out through an opening and seeing of somethingbeyond so much as the size of the opening will permit in a word thespectacular impression of looking into some beautiful outdoor worldthrough a hole in the wall the beholder must be conscious still oflooking at the wall itself the translucent part of it which confineshim within the edifice as much as the stone or the brick nor yet isthe true stained glass window merely a colored glass picture coveringso much wall area the outline form is to be so obvious and thetreatment so nonrealistic that the architectural idea may never for amoment be in danger of submersion under some other ideafor as is true in general of decorative art as contrasted withpictorial art the true church window is to be designed withoutperspective without shadow without attempt at realistic effect it isto be conventional symbolical with that intent it may utilize as itwill forms colors attitudes postures accessories fearless of thecriticism that ‘this saint or that scene never in the world looked likethat’ no intelligent person standing before decorative painting wouldfor a moment think of demanding a representation of the actual thatfrankly was not its objectand the stained glass church window will further fulfill its particularend if all round the figure or group or whatever be the subject matterof the composition there runs a clear line or border of differentlycolored glass making a clear demarcation from the stone wall drawingagain as it were the architect’s line of his window constructionall of which is but to say that windows were made for the sake of thebuilding and so must remain not that a building was made for thesake of windows――for the sake of furnishing so much space for somany square yards of somebody’s beautiful glass which ought to beselfevident though to many persons it is not                                               so regarding it now the further question naturally occurs as to thetreatment of the several windows of one particular church for eachindividual window might be in itself correct according to the aboveprinciples and yet the total effect sadly lacking in unity and harmonythere is first of all the consideration of style a difficult matterto define yet not after all so difficult to determine what oughtcertainly not to determine it is the chance ability of some wealthydonor or donors to pay for the costliest work that could be producednor on the other hand the limited ability of others who could giveonly something inexpensive the style of the building and its generalcharacter must determine the degree of splendor and ornateness whichwill be right for each and all the windows if there be wealth to dostill more then exercise sober selfrestraint if there be availablemeans only to do part of what the building demands better do just somuch as can be rightly and adequately done though the scheme shouldwait many years for its entire completion in building a new churchlet this also be thought of in advancethen there is the question of a single scheme of subjects for all thewindows so that all when completed shall tell chapter by chapterone great story or part by part one great truth say the christianfaith or the redemption of man or the sacramental economy of graceor the history of religion or the mission of the church in theworld thus again as in old time will the church windows instructthe people and the sum total of that instruction will be a unitywith harmony and interrelation of parts of the utmost value to soundchristian thinking and feeling and to symmetry of christian characterfor it is just this which our modern religion so much lacks the sadresult of sectarian thinking and teaching where each hath a doctrinea truth and few the whole doctrine and the wholeness of truthindividualism let us realize is not what the church should fosterthough individuality in its rightful place be precious and sacredthe application here is not fanciful sadly absurd examples there arewhere ecclesiastical art has been pressed into service by sectarianminds not among the sects alone to teach some one portion or fragmentof truth through the eye every time the eye gazed upon the interior ofthe house of worship and fell upon the favorite symbol or picturebut not this alone individualism is rampant in our day in theform of utterly arbitrary choice of subjects as well as of theirmode of treatment in point of material color scale of drawingand――expensiveness a babel of confusion is the result and that insome of our foremost churches which have become thereby rather picturegalleries or museums adapted to the study of all schools and alltastes than restful devotional solemnizing and uplifting temples forthe worship of almighty god a low motive ruled and how can one helpfeeling it as one looks upon the performance――here the wealthy donoror the ambitious socalled artist forgetting whose this house wasdemanded worship for himself “verily they have their reward”therefore let those who have such things in charge study first of allwhat a church should be and then what their particular church suchas they have received it in trust is it will often be found that abuilding very little esteemed has something to say for itself andis worthy of respect as originally conceived in its own structuralcharacter as designed by its architect and if not and if it mustbe borne with then all the more reason in planning to do anythingfurther in it or upon it to “abhor that which is evil and cleave tothat which is good”and after such careful study determine before the first enthusiasthas an opportunity to put into some one window chosen at random a “mostsuperb” production of the much advertised glass man determine inadvance what should be your total result when every window shall havebeen filled with stained glass what story the whole shall tell howbest its parts may be distributed what each part shall be in whatstyle what design what scale of drawing scheme of colorand when this has been determined in the fear of god in sobernessof judgment in conscientious fidelity to a sacred trust with awillingness to be judged by a wiser posterity――then let such a planbe adhered to as a law of the medes and persians which altereth notto sacrifice one window to the seductions of some alien grandeur isto sacrifice the whole principle at stake the plain glass patientlyawaiting its time to give way to the right thing is more eloquentof a truly reverent and truly artistic intention than a medley ofincongruous splendors                                               and now what is stained glass this simple question it is of theutmost importance to answer because a little familiarity with thematerials and the methods of workmanship will itself serve as a guideto the choice of good windows and to the avoidance of badstained glass then is simply glass which has been colored in the potglass which has its color within itself while painted glass――a termsometimes used as synonymous with stained glass――is properly glasswhich has had the color painted upon its surface and has then beenfired so that the colored or enameled surface has been vitrified somestained glass is of so deep a color――red for instance――that a thincoating of it blown over the surface of a white that is colorlessglass is sufficient to produce the desired color effect if the entirethickness of the pane were of the colored glass the effect would bemuch too dark such glass is nevertheless true stained glass and iscalled “flashed”in the early period of the art beginning in the eleventh century andrunning parallel with the development of pointed commonly calledgothic architecture only true stained glass was used the use ofenamel paints applied to the surface to produce a different colormarks also the beginning of the decadence of the art for the glory oftrue glass is in its jewellike quality its color being within itselfand all absolutely translucent while a painted glass will always benecessarily dull in comparison the temptation to paint color upon thesurface of glass is readily understood it was an easier method itpromised wider scope greater variety in a word the opportunity tomake pictures somewhat as the painter may upon canvas but glass isnot canvas and church windows are not to be pictures retribution hasovertaken this work and the latest and most ambitious more speedilythan all the enamelpainted glass has not stood the test of timebecoming muddy and perishing while the true ancient stained glass isstill the joy and wonder of all who gaze upon itfor as we have said the glory of true stained glass is in its richjewellike color its reds which the makers called “ruby” its blueswhich they called “sapphire” with its “emerald” greens its “gold” andits “pearl” never entered the field to compete with the achievementsof the painter’s brush to compare the delight they afford the beholderwith that derived from a painting would be in a sense as impossible asa comparison between the fragrance of a flower and the cadence of asongthe early makers of stained glass windows contended with great tomoderns they would be intolerable limitations they were almostabsolutely restricted to the primary colors they had not at first theart of blowing glass but cast their pieces in small panes of at mostfour or five inches in diameter the use of the diamond in cuttingwas not known till the sixteenth century hence their work was simplymosaic for variety they depended upon an arrangement of geometricalpatterns or patterns of familiar architectural form and of commonecclesiastical symbols to construct these they leaded together theirpieces and bits of glass elaborating their treatment as time went onbut always in the main upon the same lineswhen they began to portray in panels on their windows the forms ofour lord of his apostles of saints and angels sometimes in crudesettings of scenes or incidents from holy scripture or church legendtheir color principle was still the same and it was still the samein the elaboration of the merely ornamental borders with forms ofleaf or flower or fruit or of sacred emblems and inscriptions thebrown pigment with which they produced faces and features handsfeet outlines and ornamentations was not a color nor intended fora color but simply a means of definition or delineation when thiswas too minute to be carried out with leads and the stained glassit was still which addressed the eye and compelled attention andadmiration no more than in heraldry did the forms and emblems pretendto be pictures of the actual realistic representations of men or ofscenes or incidents the makers of early stained glass were in oneword simply makers of ornamental windows of rich color and religioussymbolismwe have said that their pieces of glass were small this is but to saythat their windows were a network of leads for there is but one way tohold together such pieces of glass in a window and that is by leadsthese leads are not a misfortune a square yard of simple red stainedglass is artistically more beautiful if composed of a hundred piecesleaded together than if it were in a single sheet the differencesin texture themselves produce a better result and the black leadsscarcely discernible individually contribute an additional elementof pleasure and in arranging pieces of different color side by sideintelligent leading design was itself the artist’s drawing andeffected results altogether admirable so far was this art of leadingcarried in france for instance that windows mainly of white glasswere produced of rare beauty by simple virtue of their structuraldesignall this was changed by the men who in a later age ground up theirenamel pigments glazed windows in large panes and daubed upon themtheir muddy colors with a sublime contempt for the crude laboriousmosaic work of their predecessors would they have a representationof the earth for their figure to stand upon it must be carpetedwith grass with green grass and they can paint green grass upon acolorless surface red flowers also upon the same with red paint ifsuch were desired the renaissance was coming gothic was barbarousanyway antiquated crudities must give place to refined work worthyof the new enlightenment paint a picture on canvas then paint thatpicture on your glass it can be done certainly if you will not allowyourself to be bothered with the nuisance of leads but just get anample pane of glass unobstructed and go at it with your brush andpaintsthis miserable travesty did not long hold sway it was scarcelypermitted to go its own theoretical length there came great politicalchanges great religious changes and for a long time few churchesmore were built nor even those standing kept in repair the courseof ecclesiastical architecture suffered an interruption for severalcenturies of which mr ralph adams cram has told us feelingly in hisrecent writings on that subject                                               but within the memory of men now living there has also come thebeginning of a true revival the awakening of the catholic spiritin the anglican communion has been accompanied by an eager desire torecover lost treasures and to restore sound traditions to their formerhonorand naturally all this has shown itself in the cultivation of stainedglass also as we have said what is needed above all else isknowledge to guide us to what is really good and worthyno sooner is any want of the public made evident than enterprisingtrade springs up to supply that want if you want colored churchwindows you can have them today at a trifle per square yard bypurchasing a beautifully printed paper of genuine ecclesiasticaldesign and pasting it upon your present windows from this mostabysmal horror of vulgarity you may pass through various successivegradations of socalled stained glass all supplied by trade if youpass on to the costliest you are not thereby sure to obtain what isnot horrible and vulgar when regarded from the point of view of truestained glass of architectural art and of religionthere are at this moment three rather diverse schools of stainedglass most in evidence before those who seek and are willing to payfor honest art work the english the german and the american theircomparative merits are nowhere to our knowledge presented in a fairminded way the makers of each claim superior excellence for theirown of course if indeed they ever intimate to the public that thereis any other kind at all it should be said however that there isgreat merit in the best examples of each school and that none of theseschools can fairly be judged by the inferior stuff which is put outunder its name for each of them is defamed by such stuffthe english school naturally had and still has great prestige amongchurchmen taking it at its best as for instance in the work ofmr henry holiday it is simple and vigorous in drawing varied andharmonious in color churchly in spirit while free from mediævalismthe english artist believes in stained glass glass which has its colorwithin itself and good glass the best he can obtain his glass isflat that is of even surface and equal thickness he believes inpainting upon this glass and upon one may say every piece and bitof it but he does not paint a color upon it he simply shades itdraws folds of drapery patterns of fabrics details of ornamentationsalways however aiming to leave it however much so painted withthe color of the glass gleaming and glittering that is he does notdaub over the surface but puts on mere lines and picks out lightsso that his painted piece of green glass let us say is still greenglass only with design upon it or texture or light and shade hefeels that only in this way has he done all which as an artist he isconscientiously bound to do and he accounts a piece of mere stainedglass which has not felt the brush at all which has not had the touchof the conscious art of the maker a poor thing in a sort crude andbarbaricin the hands of a master――and there have been great masters in theenglish school――the results of this method have been very fine buteven so the fact remains that every line and every particle of evenneutral pigment upon the surface of glass obscures so much light whichis to say it detracts so much from its brilliancy and splendor thefact is undeniable that the total effect of some great window of thisschool will be charming but withal just a little dull the richnesswhich gleams and glitters from it is yet half hidden as by somefluttering veil before it such work at its best is exquisite it isdevotional it is soothing but hardly gives one a thrill of gladnessin the hands of a master it is a fit medium for strong individualityof a good kind as witness burnejones’ windows executed at the worksof william morris in the hands of the common multitude of englishmakers it degenerates into a wearisome conventional repetition ofstiff figures draped in the same damask stuffs with the same woodenlittle flowers growing up around their feet the whole surrounded bythe same easily managed conventional borderof the german glass commonly called munich glass it is sufficient forour purpose to say that it is in principle the same as the englishit relies much upon the brush it is more in the mediæval spiritthan the english its feeling is that of a simply traditional not amodern devoutness its inspiration is italian its colors are morepredominatingly the old primary colors its decorative features arestrictly conventional and applied in a mechanical spirit in warmthin splendor of color german windows at their best are superior to theenglishamerican glass is not simply glass made in america the term denotes anew method which yet is in the main a restoration of the very oldestmethod reinforced on its own lines by modern resources mr john lafarge is its distinguished pioneeramerican glass is true stained glass but it is not glass of evensurface and of equal thicknessa by its inequality of thicknessthe american artist effects what the english artist accomplishes bybrushing dark lines upon his even glass or he leads strips and piecesof glass on the back of his window to intensify and deepen his coloras in folds of drapery and the like he paints nothing except faceshands and feet all the rest he binds himself to obtain by the mosaicmethod he cannot obtain by the mosaic method everything that theenglish artist obtains by the brush but he feels that he obtains allwhich in a window is necessary and by patient thoroughly artisticwork he obtains what upon study proves marvelous and he has all hisglass free to exhibit the full glory of glass his very necessitiescompel him to compose in the true way that is by lead lines he isback upon first principles in this respect the lead lines mark thestructural lines of his drawing but he has still to contend with thenecessity of painting his flesh parts and of overcoming the breakbetween their flatness between the dull hardness of painted faceshands and feet and the splendid jewellike strength of all the restof his window the best he can do is to make this transition as littleabrupt as possiblea the earliest glass was not glass of even surface and equalthickness therein lies one of its charmsneedless to say the american school has its dangers the ease withwhich an ignorant eye may be imposed upon by great pieces of foldedglass instead of conscientiously selected and leaded strips and piecesis a snare into which it is not necessary for an honest artist tofall when however a customer demands something cheap he can obtainit in socalled american glass and it will be cheap enough there hasbeen also a deplorable tendency among some prominent american glassmakers toward startling theatrical effects of unchurchly windowswindows hopelessly and utterly unchurchly the great majority doubtlessare of the american school nor are they the windows which have costthe least money novel and indescribable colors as far removed aspossible from all sober reverent devotional feeling have beenemployed effects have been sought which actually destroy all the valueof the window as what it was designed by its architect a window ina sacred edifice and by the wide heralding of such performances asif american glass meant simply this sort of thing american glass hasforfeited that just appreciation which in its essential principles itso richly merits let the american school remember that a window ina church is and forever must remain just a window subservient thatis to the architecture of the church let it design in the spirit ofworshipful reverent dignified sober devotion let it compose withtechnical conscientiousness and love its leads and spare no laborlet it choose thoroughly good glass and glass of predominantly theglorious colors so long honorable eschewing startling and meretriciouseffects and there will to our mind be no doubt of its being thestained glass of the futurebut to our thinking one thing cannot safely be done and that is theplacing of english and american or munich and american glass side byside in the same building let it be the one or the other when youhave chosen which it shall be adhere to that to mingle the schoolsin the same edifice will be sure to prove fatal to the best effects ofeachand before placing any permanent stained glass again let us say studythe subject see all the windows you can and make haste slowlyillustration                         stained glass windows                      for grace church lockport                a report to the vestry of the parish by                     its rector january  after many months of inquiry reflection special study and suchvisits to churches as opportunity afforded we are at last in aposition to bring together the facts bearing upon this importantproject and to submit the results for your considerationgrace churchb lockport is an edifice which though not striking orornate is in point of architectural merit of conspicuous importancein the community in probable permanence and enduring interest secondto none in our city erected more than forty years ago of stone itsinterior chastely beautified and enriched at successive periods itsnave alone over one hundred feet long fortysix feet wide fiftyfeet high its lofty chancel with a window twentytwo feet in heightnearly ten feet in width it impresses the educated eye on enteringit as beautiful and churchly characterized by simple grace andreverent dignity and the exclusion of the tawdry and incongruous wemay honestly admit some faults what building religious or otheris without them but it is a church which grows upon us the longerwe worship in it it becomes homelike to us and yet excites ouradmiration the more as we become better acquainted with itb the design was one of richard upjohn’sthis is the building which is committed to our care not only thatwe keep it clean and in repair warmed and lighted not only thatwe preserve the fabric as a valuable piece of property but thatcontinuing to labor in the spirit of those who have preceded us wesecure such further additions to it as will tend to make it complete inits kindwe say complete in its kind and it is our sacred duty thereforeto understand what it is that we already have as well as to ask whatfurther gifts and further embellishments might add thereto for toadd with the best intention and with lavish generosity but withoutan understanding of the conditions and limitations imposed by theexisting edifice might easily result in such disastrous incongruityas a future generation if not ours would deplore the land is fullof warning examples and one is at times appalled to think of the vastsums embodied in worse than waste from which our better educateddescendants after us will suffer in the years to come knowledge isbound to grow travel and study cannot fail to make an understanding ofthese things the common property of intelligent church people as timegoes on and it is a grave responsibility to be at the head of a parishin which permanent work is undertaken and executed work on which thefuture is to pronounce judgment this responsibility let me add yourrector for one feels very seriously and deeplya very common form of architectural enrichment in this day of growingwealth and of increasing commemoration of the departed is that ofstained glass windows no memorial can be more beautiful than this whenwisely planned and well executed none can be much more painful orincessantly offensive when inartistic incongruous or lacking in thetrue devotional spiritand as touching our own case it is reasonably certain that offers willbe made to place such windows in grace church it would be ungenerousto decline them moreover we cannot escape the moral obligation ofdirecting what such memorials shall be so far as the building itselfits style of architecture its uses and its history shall impose theconditions it is not a question of dictating to intending donors forthe vestry to decline to exercise such control would be for us to failof a sacred trustour church we may be most thankful to bear in mind is built in astyle pure and selfconsistent plain as it is it is early english ofthe first and simplest of the periods of gothic to treat it as if itwere of some other style in any changes or additions we might see fitto make hereafter would be to do violence to the edifice to wrong itsintelligent and loving builders in the days of good bishop de lanceyand those who shall inherit it after we are gone there is meaning andpurpose in it as it is in every line of it in every arch everydimension every grouping and distribution of partswe are not at liberty therefore to change the window openings insize or form unless indeed we wish to rebuild the church we may atour taste reconstruct the windows in the houses in which we live butwe cannot alter the style of these windows without destroying the styleof the architecture the series of long narrow lancets no matter howlong or how narrow are right and with all their severe simplicitytheir beauty of outline and their grace and dignity grow upon one themore they are studied mediæval builders had a meaning even in puttingsuch windows in pairs it may seem to us a little fantastic but asthey made everything symbolical so in this grouping they symbolizedour lord’s sending out his apostles two and two apart from such aconsideration there is a quiet grace in this long succession oflancet pairs which may safely be left to speak for itselfthe development of window forms is itself very interesting and shouldbe understood before an attempt is made to treat any church windowsin particular mrs van rensselaer who has done so much to make theenglish cathedrals known in this country thus traces the successivesteps from style to style “fancy first a plain tall window with aroundarched head then the round exchanged for a pointed head thentwo or three or five perhaps of these pointed windows set closetogether and then a projecting moulding in the shape of an arch drawnaround them including them all and thus including of necessity aplain piece of wall above their heads then fancy this piece of wallpierced with a few small openings and we have a group of connectedlights in which as a plant in its embryo lies the promise of allafterdevelopment“the small lights in the upper field enlarge and multiply until theyform a connected pattern which fills its whole area and the jambs ofthe main lights diminish into narrow strips or very slender columnsthe great arch which in the first place did but encircle the windowsthus becomes itself the window――the ‘platetraceried’ window which wasrichly developed in early french gothic but less richly in englishowing to the persistent local love for mere groups of lancets thenall the stonework shrinks still farther――the columnar character ofthe uprights is lost and the flat surfaces between the upper openingschange into mouldings of complex section thus the original talllights and upper piercings surrender their last claim to independencethe uprights are no longer jambs or bits of wall but mullions thearchhead is filled with genuine traceries and all the elements of thedesign are vitally fused together within the sweep of the great windowto form its multiple yet organic beauty”the art of making stained glass windows went hand in hand with thisdevelopment of architectural forms through the eleventh twelfththirteenth and succeeding centuries it has indeed been calledthe “principal branch of mediæval art” but was always treated asabsolutely subservient to the particular architecture itself a mosteminent authority denies that the art of glassstaining has ever beenlost glass itself was used by christians in their churches from theearliest churchbuilding times the distinct art of painting on glassemerges one might say with the springing up of pointed architecturethough the beginnings show themselves in norman architecture in theeleventh century four centuries the two arts flourished side byside with the decadence of the greater came also the decline of thesubsidiary a poorer taste in building was naturally accompaniedby a poorer taste in glass with the revival of interest in thoselongneglected periods of noble achievement the oxford movement ofchurch restoration giving men the religious guiding principles for anintelligent appreciation of the forms of mediæval art church buildingand glass staining were brought back again the one with the other andwhether such restoration can leave us satisfied with the mere recoveryof the riches of bygone ages or must mean also as i believe thedevelopment of what the present can contribute in a reverent but notslavish spirit――certain it is that the first step is to understand thepast to find out what was done in the great formative and classicperiods why it was done as it was and not otherwise in a word tomaster the models before we proceed on our own course and as i saidbefore to remember to which period and style our own edifice belongsit was my good fortune when recently in the city of philadelphia toobtain access to a rare work over which i spent some very delightfulhours its author was a william warrington himself a designer andproducer of windows and a reverent student of ancient examples whopublished his great folio in london in  from him i learned manythings about the beginnings and progress of the art great were thedifficulties of the eleventh century pioneers they had to contendwith defective methods of manufacture not understanding glassblowingthey fused their glass in pots and crucibles and cast it to aboutthe required shape in pieces not more than four or five inches indiameter cutting with the diamond was not known till the sixteenthcentury they designed and made and erected their own work whengreat orders were to be executed artists were brought together fromthe different countries and by a sort of “freemasonry” they workedtogether in perfect agreement as to styles rules and principlesin the course of time different countries produced slightly differingschoolsas in heraldry the colors of the glass were intended for colors ofprecious stones the representations of figures and objects were notmeant to be pictures but being also strictly symbolical the drawingwas conventional with no intention to reproduce nature in color orform or position and perspective the figures which excite ridiculeon the part of one who is without the clue justify themselves by thisprinciple nor is it quite true to say the men of that time did notknow how to draw――their ability in this respect was not that of artiststoday but if their object had been to produce a figure or a scene forthe sole purpose of a picture they might certainly and would certainlyhave given us something very different from what they did while thesmall separate pieces are often very minutely pencilled all such workbeing afterward burned in――there is no “shadowing” as in a picturesupposing the light to fall from a certain direction but a kind of“relief” shading making the view suitable to any aspect in a wordthe drawing is the same as in mss tapestries and heraldic designsruby and sapphire were the ground colors and in all the work theprimitive colors were adhered toin york minister there is to be found the largest and finest specimenof thirteenth century glass in england in a group of lancets knownas the “five sisters” the lancets are each six feet wide and fiftyfeet high and each divided into thirteen compartments or squaresof different patterns their designs being largely of an ornamentalcharacter they escaped destruction by the puritansit is a curious fact that english stained glass at no time had largefigures in the thirteenth century continental art in this respectdiverged from ancient and english under italian influencein the cathedral of bourges there are one hundred and eightythreestained glass windows executed from the thirteenth century downwardsthe early lancets have figures occupying the larger part of the windowsometimes fifteen or twenty feet high over each figure a sort ofcanopy or tabernacle disproportionately small and under it a kind ofpedestal or base about a foot high around the margin is the finestwork in the windows in a broad band of mosaiccologne cathedral has four lancets each eleven times its width inheight filled with early glass of this period the figures in thewindows are in height onethird the height of the lancet with a canopyabove themthe developments of the centuries following are of less interest to ourpresent purpose suffice it to say that even in the rich decoratedstyle of architecture the treatment of individual windows was not whatwe might term ambitious the effect was secured by not attemptingtoo much in a single window but by producing a rich harmony withsubordination of each to the whole in the perpendicular style whichfollowed in the fifteenth century while there was a very abundantproduction of glass its quality was inferior and much white glass wasused figures with canopies were used when the single openings wereone foot wide and upward panels when they were considerably largerand to fill the extreme length story upon story and there begins toappear a tendency to conform the glass less to the architecture itselffrom the sixteenth century on there is marked decay the attempts totreat glass like canvas prove an entire failure a voluptuous andsensual school of painting came in debasing a religious art whichthus became secularized and almost disappeared the destruction offine ancient examples in the puritan revolution left england very poorand the little that remained came to be less and less appreciatedcuriously enough large importations of glass consequent on the frenchrevolution with its destruction of churches put into the hands ofenglish churchmen what the religious revival of the church soontaught them to appreciate once more and so it is that today englandis enriching her cathedrals and churches with restorations and newwindows and from her the impulse has naturally come to our own landalso but the production of stained glass is in america of very recentdatefrom facts like the foregoing we may conclude that the subject is oneof importance and involving so much that it is well that we shouldproceed cautiously in the placing of stained glass in grace churchbut shall we encourage such a movement at allit seems to me that this is the moment supremely opportune for us toinaugurate a scheme of window treatment such as shall glorify our houseof god more and more till it reaches completion how long it may taketo reach completion is in a sense immaterial that we should begin nowand make every step a right one is the great matterthe practical question is shall we choose to admit one or a fewstriking windows into this edifice windows which may have no relationto each other produced possibly by methods or on principles entirelyat variance in colorschemes discordant in scale of drawing entirelydissimilar and unequal or shall we guide intending donors to suchgifts as shall be a satisfaction and a delight forever beautifuleach in itself but more beautiful still when assembled this i takeit is the question for i believe windows will be placed whether weencourage it or not within a decade possibly much sooner and wheni put the question thus it appears to me there is but one answerpossiblelet us then get down to the practical details in the matter leavingthe great chancel window entirely out of consideration we have fivepairs of lancets of equal size on either side of the nave and a sixthsmaller pair over the doors in continuation of the series up to thechancel we have further the magnificent group of three lancets at thefoot of the nave with a fourth lancet a little smaller and still muchlarger than those in the pairs already referred tohere is a considerable number of windows――twentynine when we countin the chancel window what an opportunity for discord and artisticanarchy let us say rather what a remarkable and rare opportunity forthe production of a rich and hallowed splendor fitted not only toexpress the consecration of man’s gifts to god but to instruct theminds and quicken the devotions of generations to comethe objection which most readily offers itself when stained glass isproposed for grace church is that the twenty lancets at the sides areso extremely narrow and so very high that nothing can be done withthem if by ‘doing something’ is meant putting in scenes with severalor many figures it is most true the breadth of wall between the twowindows constituting the pair is so large that the scene could not becarried from the one to the other but surely that does not exhaust thepossibilities the openings are wide enough to permit the treatment ofsingle figures in full lifesize if desired figures with canopiesborders and panels at the base as in the best periods of ancientglass the breadth of these openings is twentyone inches six inchesmore than that of the small pair erected all saints  at the sideof the pulpit in which the figures are certainly of dignified statureand by no means poor in back ground and accessories if such resultsare possible in a space fifteen inches wide and six feet high how muchmore in a space twentyone inches wide and thirteen feet highsingle figures therefore are demanded by the conditions which governus for the side lancets unless we rest content with geometricalor flower windows or windows bearing emblems more or less ornatelybordered i venture to say that at this stage of our history whenwe are not pressed to fill our windowopenings with whatever may beobtainable we desire the best that can be had this best for the sidelancets is――single figures with canopy border and base panelmr f s lamb of new york who designed the beautiful work erecteda year ago has prepared and sent me two pairs of colored sketchessuggesting a noble and beautiful form which in the execution would ofcourse far surpass what appears in the drawings they are submittedfor your careful study and may be seen at any time in my librarywhat then shall the figures be shall they be chosen at randomartistically speaking this might not be so disastrous provided thesame artist drew all the designs and controlled the execution so thatthe scale of drawing and the scheme of color were kept in accord andthat is a great deal more than can be said of some of the principalchurches in our greatest cities where immense sums have been spent onthese works no there is something better still open to us it is aserial treatment with unity and progress so that the whole whencomplete shall tell one great story each part a chapter thereinthe whole impress one truth each part contributing somewhat to thecumulative force of the great lessonand not to detain you with all the processes of thought and longreflection by which at last we reach our conclusion――the figures wesuggest are those which are conspicuous and representative in theold and new testaments our divine lord himself should be as he isexalted in the great window over the altar beginning from the angleof the chancel arch to pass around the church we come first to thepair of small windows next to the organ from which now the light isexcluded by the parish building they may be taken as in a sense goingwith the organ and scarcely a part of the general scheme let thembe treated at some time in mosaic with singing angelsc thuscorresponding to the angels directly opposite in the correspondingsmall windows then we pass to the first pair of lancets of uniformsize melchizedek and abraham the latter the great father of thefaithful the head of the covenant people the former even superiorto him a priest forever without beginning or end of days type ofour lord’s own highpriesthood melchizedek appears before abrahambearing bread and wine

available only for the subject assignedto it treated in the best style under the direction and approvalof the vestry windows may be erected in any order provided theseconditions are complied with though it is highly desirable that notless than a pair――where there are pairs――should be placed at a timeit is immaterial how many persons join in donating a window the useof the windows for memorials is very beautiful and very desirable butthere is no restriction to such use by anything in the schemeand in closing let it be added that if――as undoubtedly they will――thevestry and parish shall feel sincerely thankful to those whoparticipate in this pious work it is not there that the gratitudeshould chiefly lie it is an unspeakable privilege to be permittedto place a memorial like this in the house of god bringing ever newcomfort and joy to hearts bereaved and satisfaction to the donorsyes if there is need to say it it is an honor to be permitted to doit moreover in the nature of the case it is a privilege very limitedas to the number of those who can be so favored and with every windowthat is taken the number remaining available becomes rapidly less
